Anxiety arises from various uncertainties that themselves can become sources of tangible disturbances exclusively for a being whose relations with itself (via intrasubjective self-objectification) and others (via inter-or subjective objectification) are routed through and modulated by ensembles of sociosymbolic configurations (i.e., \"discourses\"). Thanks to discourses and everything they bring with them, the subject \"captured\" by the signifier can come anxiously to ask what it is, as an object (especially an object of desire), for both others and itself; and, also thanks to immersion in the worlds of signifiers, such inquiring subjectivity never will alight upon definitive, final answers to its questions granting unshakeable certainty.l2l If anxiety is not only the only affect for \\npsychoanalysis but also the sole affect that doesn\\'t deceive, then all other affects (as emotions and feelings) can become causes for anxiety (as an affect proper) insofar as their deceptiveness, a deceptiveness engendered by their sociosymbolic mediation, invariably allows for casting them into doubt. As a sociosymbolic being (i.e., a parletre), one always can wonder warily, in a gesture of self-objectification, whether one honestly feels what one seemingly feels (in addition to whether others honestly feel what they indicate they feel). What could be more anxiety-inducing than feeling that one cannot trust one\\'s feelings, that one\\'s heart and soul might tell half-truths or utter falsehoods? To borrow the title of one of Laplanche\\'s books (La revolution enne inachevee), there is another \"unfinished\" aspect to the Copernican tion of psychoanalysis. As I\\'ve observed already (in chapter 8), Lacan, apropos Freud\\'s references to Copernicus, emphasizes the analytic dissolution of the illusion of knowledge\\'s inherent reflexivity that is transparent to itself; the (subject of the) unconscious subverts the notion of the self-conscious subject that supposedly, when it knows, necessarily knows that it knows. In the nian account, what remains unfinished in the Freudian Copernican revolution is the thinking-through of the full extent of the subversion of knowing tivity brought about by the psychoanalytic discovery of the unconscious as a knowledge that doesn\\'t know itself, a subversion partially obfuscated by Freud\\'s manner of interpreting his own invocation of Copernicus. (As explained viously, the pain of the blow to humanity\\'s self-image by the earth\\'s celestial decentering is mitigated and compensated for by narcissistic pride at having achieved knowledge of this decentering.) Along these lines, Lacan positions himself with respect to Freud as extending to their consequent logical ends tain crucial revolutionary trajectories that, although not followed through to I48 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

Lacan\\'s \"return to Freud\" could be depicted as an analytic-dialectical retrieval and deployment of the \"unknown knowns\" of the Freudian oeuvre (as Heidegger would phrase it, Lacan \"thinks the unthought\" of Freud). Whereas Lacan\\'s finishing of unfinished Freudian business generally focuses on thinking and knowing, with the thinking that doesn\\'t think that it thinks and the knowing that doesn\\'t know that it knows both being dynamics and structures of a fundamentally mal-linguistic-representational nature, my finishing of unfinished Lacanian business focuses on feeling as being not transparent to itself: Additionally, unlike the many critical readings of Lacan that see nothing in his teachings doing real justice to things not of a tational nature, I acknowledge that, although underemphasized and in need of further elaboration, a number of resources indeed are to be found in the Lacanian corpus for the development of a richer, more subtle metapsychology of affective life that is able to be interfaced productively with the findings of the contemporary neuroscience of the emotional brain. Even though Lacan repeatedly denies the existence of unconscious affects, considering the very phrase \"unconscious affects\" to be self-contradictory (as Freud too sometimes does), his scattered reflections on affects nonetheless hint that subjects can be \"strangers to themselves\" at the level of feeling as well as at the levels (not lated to feeling) of thinking and knowing. But, a \"return to Lacan\" modeled on Lacan\\'s return to Freud is required if these resources and hints are to be extracted and extrapolated in new directions that are neither simply Lacanian nor non-Lacanian.

       " '12. EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN FROM PSYCHOANALYSIS TO THE NEUROSCIENCES Among those readers of Lacan not inclined immediately to denounce his version of psychoanalysis as entirely devoid of any serious and sustained treatment of affective life-Lacanian psychoanalysis is all too frequently caricatured as a disembodied, formalist structuralism ing everything apart from static symbolic-linguistic systems-much attention has been paid to his tenth seminar. As noted, Lacan himself appeals to this particular seminar, with its focus on anxiety, as exculpatory evidence against accusations that he mishandles or ignores affects (accusations coming from a number of quarters: phenomenologies, poststructuralisms, isms, feminisms, non-Lacanian psychoanalytic orientations, and so on). ous exegetes sympathetic to Lacan, taking their lead from this appeal, attempt to derive a broader Lacanian metapsychology of affect from his discussions of anxiety in 1962-1963. But, one already might ask at this point: given the undeniable existence of numerous phenomena that are identifiable as \"affective;\\' how can a mere academic-year-out-of-twenty-seven examination of anxiety alone be presented as an adequately thorough psychoanalytic theorization of affects? tively anticipating one likely Lacanian response among others to this question, one might pose another query that seems appropriate: what justifies asserting that anxiety is the single, sole affect recognized as such by psychoanalysis, when so many other affects appear to be important and relevant in both clinical and ',\n",
       " 'pre-cisc sort many consequences, estrangement from one\\'s emotions and feelings as dent, self-transparent conscious experiences-in other words, as a parihre, one is deprived of the guarantee of certainty that, when one feels a feeling, one feels that one feels this feeling as such-then anxiety is the uniquely human affect. Why? Only human beings become subjects qua speaking beings ($); and, one of the results of such subjectification is, by virtue of the mediation of signifiers, a loss of any (pre )supposed immediacy at the level of affective experience. The subject\\'s ensuing uncertainties about its emotions and feelings, uncertainties deliberately aggravated and intensified in analysands by the analytic process, generate any number of sensations that can span the negative sensational spectrum, ranging from subtle, low-burn discomfort to acute, consuming angst, from being vaguely ill at ease to being frantic with panic (the latter state sometimes precipitating rash behaviors of the sort referred to by all analytic orientations as instances of \"acting-out\").! Every point along this range arguably involves anxiety, itself arguably distinct from any similar states of sensation (such as fear) apparently common to both humans and animals. Thus, on this interpretation, Lacan isn\\'t saying that anxiety is the only emotion or feeling of interest and pertinence to psychoanalysis. Rather, his partially outlined metapsychology of affective life proposes a tacit tinction between, on the one hand, affect and, on the other hand, emotion and feeling (one ought to recall the earlier unearthing and extensions of the Affikt-Gefohi-Empjindung triad buried in Freud\\'s original German texts and, somewhat surprisingly, passed over without remark by Lacan). Hence, less emotions and feelings could be taken into account by a Lacanian analysis. But, with respect to these passions and sentiments, if analytic attention should be paid principally to those moments when doubts of various sorts can and do arise regarding conscious emotions and feelings, then anxiety, as the affective accompaniment of such doubts, is indeed, as Lacan contends, the \"central\" and \"fundamental\" affect, at least as far as analyses of the unconscious dimensions of speaking beings qua split subjects of signifiers are concerned. However, to be perfectly exact before proceeding further, the Lacan of the tenth seminar doesn\\'t claim, as these previous articulations are at risk of gesting, that doubts (as intellectual causes) give rise to anxiety (as an affective effect). the contrary: one of Lac an\\'s theses on anxiety, stated during the year of ie Seminaire devoted to it, is that \"anxiety is the cause of doubt.\"2 ety is a \"pre-sentiment;\\' \"that which is before the birth of a sentiment;\\'3 namely, EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł lSI ',\n",
       " 'a vague premonition of the bursting-forth of new, unexpected affective or libidinal intensities indicative of that which has been unconscious. These ments are made with reference to phenomena familiar in the clinical treatment of obsessional neurosis: When anxiety arises in obsessionals-and, for Lacan, this agitating presentiment doesn\\'t deceive insofar as it can be trusted as a nal that objects closely associated with unconscious desires are lurking where in the contextual vicinity-they try to fend it off, tamp it down, and fool themselves about it. Obsessional neurotics attempt this mainly through lectualizations and rationalizations taking the form of a proliferation of tant, tentative self-interpretations creating feelings of uncertainty (Le., doubt) about feelings. How they feel is thereby buried in a hodgepodge haystack of conflicting, incompatible speculations. As Lacan puts it, \"Doubt ... is made for nothing else but combating anxiety, and this precisely by its lures.\"4 When this type of neurotic anxiety surfaces as an advance indication that against emotions and desires are threatening to irrupt into the scene of sciousness, a verbal swarm of confusing pseudoexplanations is conjured up to create deceptions allowing for skepticism as to whether any affective bance really is occurring. This skepticism struggles to sustain the illusion that nothing deviating from the narrow parameters of what the obsessional deems normal and manageable actually is in danger of transpiring. So, do Lacan\\'s stipulations in 1962 to the effect that affective anxiety is the cause of intellectual doubt, as glossed in the previous paragraph, invalidate ceding discussions here in which it\\'s hypothesized that the doubt-anxiety tion can operate in the opposite causal direction too? The answer is a definite \"No!\" for several reasons. First of all, at a very basic and broad level, one might simply (and not without justification) disagree with Lacan about the dynamics of interaction between the affective and the intellectual, dynamics he tends not to delineate in a sufficiently dialectical fashion. The approach adopted by me in this project is most certainly not one governed by a mindless, rigid tion that Lacan is infallible. Second, whether Lacan\\'s indications regarding the role of doubt specifically in obsessional neurotic defenses against anxiety generally apply across the board to any and every psychical subject in an arching metapsychological model is quite questionable. As should be apparent from my prior citations of other assertions made by Lacan in the course of my arguing for the view that anxiety is related to a hystericization particularly a-vis emotions, passions, sentiments, and the like, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that Lacan elsewhere admits the existence of an anxiety generated by doubts about the feel of feelings, worries about the specters of misfelt feelings 152 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " \"several years after the seminar on f angoisse in which obsessional doubt is said to be triggered by anxiety (instead of vice versa). Debates undoubtedly could be had about whether and to what extent Lacan's comments on affects starting in the seventeenth seminar are consistent with those situated in earlier contexts (such as the tenth seminar). Fourth and finally, as regards doubt, Lacan talks about it along different lines the following year, in his famous eleventh seminar on Ihe Four Fundamental Concepts ofPsJcho-Analysis (as well as on a number of other occasions too). In addition to the doubts of obsessional neurotics, one might wonder about the functions and significance of doubt in nonobsessional analysand-subjects; one also might wonder about doubts on the side of the listening analyst apart from those on the side of the speaking analysand. All I need to point out in the current setting is that Lacan's multifaceted izations of doubt subsequent to the tenth seminar are far from pigeonholing it as nothing more than a defense against anxiety mounted exclusively by sional neurotics in analysis.' As seen, my excavation of the rudiments of a Lacan-inspired ogy of affects-this metapsychology of affects is both centered on the thesis that, like knowing and thinking according to psychoanalysis, feeling also is non-self-reflexive and a theoretical framework potentially compatible with the neurosciences-derives many of its findings from the seventeenth nar. And, as I mentioned a while ago (in chapter 8), this seminar recently has attracted a lot of attention from Lacanians interested in exploring Lacan's course on affect and, in so doing, providing additional testimony to the effect that Lacan isn't guilty, as regularly and recurrently charged by a chorus of ics, of an unpardonable silence on this psychoanalytically unavoidable subject matter. However, these contemporary Lacanian scholars don't address those parts of the seventeenth seminar scrutinized earlier here; instead, they share an exclusive preoccupation with a few passing observations Lacan utters about shame at the opening and closing moments of the final seminar session (June 17, 1970) of this academic year.6 Jacques-Alain Miller and others argue that, in surrounding collective atmospheres infused with the lingering scents of Paris's May '68 and everything of which this convulsive outburst was a symptom, Lacan sees fit to make his audience aware of the historically unprecedented shamelessness so widespread in the crass, materialistic world of consumerist mass-media late capitalism7 (a vulgar, exhibitionistic shamelessness on display among some of the provocative agitators in the audience when Lacan spoke at EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł IS3 \",\n",
       " 'Vincennes in 8 The lines drawn of shame in Lacanian summarized by me \",\\',,,n,prp 9 will not be further in what fol-lows. Instead, my reflections will zero in on the implications of Lacan\\'s few scant-but-allusive comments on the topic of shame for a psychoanalytic theory of affective life whose relevance isn\\'t confined to a postmodern era of cheap plastic toys and television reality shows. As with his renowned recasting of the superego in the twentieth seminar,lO Lacan\\'s perspectives on shame are situated in two registers simultaneously: one more historical and contextual, the other more structural and transcontextual (i.e., metapsychological). Joan Copjec is among those notable Lacanian scholars who highlight Lacan\\'s calls for a bit more shame at the last meeting of the seventeenth nar. In particular, her essay \"May\\' 68, The Emotional Month\" is a careful, sophisticated historical contextualization of this academic year, an academic year situated in an unsettled cultural and political climate palpably perturbed by the aftershocks of France\\'s mass uprisings of students and workers alike. Copjec\\'s meticulous, thoughtful exploration of Lacanian shame gets well and truly underway thus: \"In response to May\\' 68, a very emotional month, he ends his seminar, his long warning against the rampant and misguided ism of the university students, with an impassioned plea for a display of shame. Curb your impudence, your shamelessness, he exhorts, cautioning: you should be ashamed! What effrontery! What a provocation is this seminar! But then: what are we to make of it? Because the reference to shame appears so abruptly only in the final session and without elaboration, this is not an easy question to answer.\"ll Like other recent readers of Lac an\\'s appeals to shame in 1970, Copjec seems to adopt an angle of exegetical approach privileging the sociohistorical motivations behind and resonance of these appeals. And yet, Copjec\\'s ing efforts to answer her opening question regarding shame (\"what are we to make of it ?\") reveal a convergence of interests between her endeavors in this essay and the project I\\'m pursuing here. In both cases, the seventeenth seminar, admittedly situated as it is in such intensely determinative cultural \\nand tutional circumstances, is interpreted as saying things about affect that go well beyond the limits of its proximity to the event of May\\' 68. Of course, Lacan does intervene in manners intended to address those of his auditors gripped by the passions of their specific time and place; these interventions indeed speak to a peculiar late-capitalist Zeitgeist differing in important respects from the era enveloping Freud. But, apropos affects and their delineation in psychoanalysis (not to mention a number of other topics too), the Lacan of 154 Ł MISFELT FEE,LINGS ',\n",
       " 'remains as committed as forward Freud\\'s theoretical framework as he becomes, in this academic year especially, concerned with revising and refining Freudian metapsychology by putting this conceptual apparatus into a dialectical rapport with the evident facts of new widespread phenomena unknown to and unforeseen by FreudY Again, a transcontextual metapsychology of affects can and should ate resources from the Lacan of this event-conditioned context of post-May \\'68 Paris. However, despite some overlap at the level of aims and approaches, I part company from Copiec with respect to two key matters: the question of scious affect in general and the understanding of the significance of the words affect and shame in Lacan\\'s texts in particular. To begin with the first of these differences, Copiec reiterates several times the Lacanian assertion, edly resting on firm Freudian foundations, that, in terms of being repressed, \"affect never is.\"l3 Invoking \"Freud\\'s critical assertion that only ideas are ever repressed:\\' she maintains: \"Affect remains on the surface. This does not mean that repression has no effect on affect [jouissance l; it means, rather, that this effect is something other than the removal of affect from consciousness. The specific effect of repression on affect is displacement. Affect is always displaced, or: always out of place.\"l4 Copiec takes Lacan\\'s word that affects, according to Freud, cannot succumb to the psychical vicissitude of repression insofar as they are feelings. This is problematic for several reasons: Not only does this claim ignore the different terms Freud employs when discussing affective life (i.e., Affekt, Gefuhl, and Empjindung), but it also wrongly alleges that Freud tently and categorically denies the existence of emotional phenomena below the superficial threshold of explicit conscious awareness. As shown previously, there are a plethora of instances, starting as early as 1907, in which Freud ders the possibility of unconscious affect. But, what\\'s more, the place in which Freud purportedly issues the decisive decree stating that affects can only ever be displaced within consciousness instead of repressed into unconsciousness-the place in question, regularly cited by Lacan and those sympathetic to his views on this point, is the third section (\"Unconscious Emotions\") of the logical paper on \"The Unconscious\" (I9IS)-is far from decisive. As revc2Jed by my earlier detailed examination of Freud\\'s German, Freud wavers in relation to this topic even within the span of this single three-page section. And, as will be seen shortly, what his hesitations and oscillations therein (ignored by Lacan and Copiec, as well as many others) reveal has consequences for the Lacanian handling of shame as an affect. EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł ISS ',\n",
       " 'Another limitation to Copjec\\'s reading of Lacan\\'s seventeenth seminar is its relative neglect of the nuances and subtleties of the remarks regarding affect (remarks unpacked at length in chapter II) in all but the final session of that academic year. Like a handful of other Lacanians, she devotes most of her tion to shame as it appears in that year\\'s last meeting. However, like Alenka ZupanCic,ls Copjec rightly observes that this annual seminar involves, among other things, Lacan reworking his long-standing black-and-white dichotomy between the signifier (as the intellectual-representational) and jouissance (as the affective-libidinal).16 jouis-sens, with its muddied shades of gray, begins to crystallize at this moment. And yet, none of this leads to questioning skeptically the old story, erroneously imputed to the authority of Freud, about affects as nothing more than mobile lumps in the carpet of consciousness set in motion by being pushed about (i.e., displaced) as a secondary result of the effects of defense mechanisms (repression first and foremost) operating exclusively on ideational and mnemic materials. Although both Freud and Lacan sometimes articulate conceptions of affects along these lines, a comprehensive survey of their various and varying pronouncements bearing upon matters of passions renders such a clear-cut, straightforward depiction of affect in Lacanian psychoanalysis (as never repressed, as always displaced) suspect. Furthermore, when this survey takes into account the precise German and French phrasings of these pronouncements, the picture gets even more complex. Sometimes sounding audibly frustrated and contemptuous, Lacan tirelessly pleads with his audience to acquaint themselves with Freud\\'s texts in their inal tongue, insisting that fundamental conceptual understandings and derstandings hinge on whether or not one gains adequate access to the syntax and semantics of the German language in which the founding documents of psychoanalysis are written. The devil resides in the details not only in the cal setting of the analyst\\'s consulting room. Although Lacan\\'s neglect of the translation and interpretation difficulties posed by the German words Freud employs in his discussions of affective life is a notably rare and uncharacteristic exception to the former\\'s own rule-this exception indeed proves the rule far as these strangely neglected German concept-terms arguably come back to haunt Lacan\\'s own analytic understanding and handling of affects-a return to Lacan interested in affect must scrutinize the French used by the \"French Freud.\" When it comes to affect-language of all sorts, the distinctions between connotatiofoLs of words for affective phenomena in various natural languages are crucial to observe for at least two reasons: first, different natural languages splice up and organize fluid emotional spectrums differently; second, these 156 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'affective hues are not without real and direct repercussions for the affective lives of the beings whose visceral emotions and feelings are mediated the very languages that they speak. In fact, particularly when it comes to an English-language exegesis of a language discourse on shame, this sensitivity to linguistic precision is especially crucial. Copjec contends that Lacan\\'s talk of shame in 1970 is far from edented in his teachings, citing, among other references, his famous seventh seminar of a decade priorP This is where certain problems begin to arise. The French word translated as \"shame\" at the end of the seventeenth seminar is honte,l8 and this final session of that academic year is one of only three sions on which Lacan speaks, briefly and in passing, of honte in Ie Seminaire (the other two occur in seminars eight and eleven,l9 with Copjec citing the latter but not the former). A different French word, pudeur (also translated as \"shame\"), is used by Lacan in the majority of those contexts referenced or alluded to by Copjec as precursors of his post-May \\'68 revival of shame. But, how do honte and pudeur differ from each other? Moreover, what difference does recognizing this English-elided terminological distinction make? Why is this important, particularly as regards a psychoanalytic metapsychology of affect? The contrast between honte and pudeur consists in the former word ring to an affect as a felt feeling (i.e., as a consciously registered sensation gibly experienced) and the latter word referring to a predisposition toward being capable of feeling certain feelings. Simply put: \"Honte is shame as an excruciatingly uncomfortable, embarrassed feeling actually felt (as in \\'I feel ashamed right now\\'). By contrast, pudeur is the potential capacity for or ceptibility to experiencing honte, a capacity/susceptibility that, in the form of the ethico-moral self-restraints of what is sometimes called \\'modesty\\' or \\'tact: keeps one from crossing lines or transgressing those boundaries that would produce an actually felt upsurge of negative affect (as in, apropos a person ing this tactful modesty, \\'Have you no shame?\\').\"2o Interestingly, this French semantic difference can be correlated with Freud\\'s previously traced German distinction between Empjindung (feeling) and Affiktbildung (affective ture or formation): Honte designates a felt feeling qua Empjindung, whereas pudeur designates a potential to feel qua Affiktbildung (rather than a feeling felt in actuality); indeed, German allows for a distinction between Scham and SchamgeJuhl (as per the title of a book by Max Scheler) corresponding to that between pudeur and honte, respectively. Accordingly, honte, as an Empjindung, EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł IS7 ',\n",
       " 'is a conscious experience involving a specific set of sensations; by contrast, pudeur, as an A.ffektbildung, involves chains of ideational representations that can be either conscious or unconscious (as in the Freudian superego, a science not all of which is conscious). To say that honte and pudeur both mean \"shame\" in the same sense and are both words for an \"affect\" in the same sense would be inaccurate and misleading. In fact, if one identifies pudeur qua A.ffektbildung as an affect, then, contra the Lacanian line adhered to by Copjec, one concedes the existence of scious affects, unless one is willing to contradict Freud\\'s well-supported and explanatorily invaluable contention that much of the superego, itself sible for intrapsychically enforcing modest, tactful restraint (pudeur), is scious. In her analyses of shame in Lacan\\'s teachings, Copjec\\'s lovely, polished English, usually so deft and illuminating, reveals a tendency to conflate the two senses of shame as honte and pudeur. While addreSSing shame (as honte) in the seventeenth seminar, she claims this to be a continuation of preceding nian reflections on shame (generally as pudeur), proceeding to present all of these scattered instances in Lacan\\'s seminars as occasions on which Lacan les the problem of affect (with no mention made of crucial distinctions such as those between Empfindung and A.ffektbildung, actual and potential affects, and so on).21 Admittedly, Lacan, once in a while permitting himself a more relaxed tionship to his native French tongue, sometimes lapses into an indistinction between honte and pudeur allowed for in nontechnical quotidian speech. In the sixth seminar, when describing the blush of a miser provoked by another\\'s gaze glimpsing the unveiled secret treasure of one of his hoarded \"intimate objects,\" Lacan employs pudeur as synonymous with honte to designate the felt feeling of embarrassment.22 In the eighth seminar, honte and pudeur are used in close proximity to each other.23 However, these few aberrant and casual cations between honte and pudeur aside (not to mention the rare references to honte alone in the eleventh and seventeenth seminars), the rest of Lac an\\'s linked, cross-resonating remarks on \"shame\" (pudeur) implicitly but clearly pertain not to shame as an affect (i.e., honte qua Empjindung, an excruciating, burning affective state of consciousness), but to affective structures or tions (A.ffektbildungen) enforcing a limiting restraint, in the forms of modesty and tact (whether consciously or unconsciously respected), through the tial to produce the feelings of embarrassment, humiliation, and so on. Starting in the fifth seminar and the contemporaneous ecrit \"The fication of the Phallus,\" Lacan repeatedly summons the \"demon of shame\" IS8 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'demon de This invocation occurs with reference ture of \"the terrified woman\" from the frescos of the Villa of the M\\\\l<t/\\'rll\\'\" at Pompeii (the image-scene depicting this recoiling female adorns the cover of the French edition of Lacan\\'s Television published in 1973),2\\' Lacan interprets this painted ancient woman, at the threshold of a type passage, as horrified precisely by the sudden unveiling of the phallus; she is said to embody the shame qua modesty (i.e., pudeur) that is integrally complicit in sustaining the apparent potency of this symbolic entity through refusing to tear aside the layers of cloth beneath which it normally remains hidden.26 Among other things, the Lacanian phallus signifies a potent ness and vital fullness (\"by virtue of its turgidity ... the image of the vital flow as it is transmitted in generation\") both inaccessible and unattainable for speaking subjects; as such, this illusory x effectively functions as a lure solely when its presence is hinted at indirectly through screens and disguises (\"it can play its role only when veiled\").27 According to the general Lacanian logic of the curtain or veil, coverings sustain the sense that there is something being covered, a substantial thing concealed behind the barrier of a Through this effect, curtains or veils, such as those covering phallic entities, even can create the illusion of something where there is nothing.28 Alluring avatars and promises of phallic power and completion retain their seductive aura solely insofar as respectful restraint (again,pudeur) stays the hand that might otherwise, in aiming to seize such phalli directly, inadvertently tear away masks hiding nothing, thus disrupting the masquerade by calling its bluff (and ending up empty-handed in the process). Immodestly and lessly tossing aside the crowns of kings and the gavels of judges reveals the near nothingness of mere mortals, of miserable, fragile animal bodies. Those who are shameless (sans pudeur, sans vergogne), like children who have yet to know shame, are prone to blurt out such disturbing truths as that the lic emperor is naked, that emperor-phallus is nothing more than a sagging, wrinkled bit of spent flesh (and not, as it appears when veiled, an eternally erect font of an indestructible life force). Like both Freud\\'s \"little Hans\" and his curious young fetishist-to-be, those who peer behind the ornamental erings of clothes see-oh! horror of horrors-gaping absence where eager anticipation expected full, protruding presence. When the limits maintained by pudeur are disrespected and violated, honte and disgust tend to arise.29 These affects (as felt feelings, as Empjindungen) are symptomatic of ity itself as constituted partially on the basis of restraining barriers and ders,30 of limiting constraints of which pudeur qua Affiktbildung (sometimes EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł 159 ',\n",
       " 'conscious, sometimes unconscious) is an instance (\"the dimension of shame, a dimension that is proper only to the subject as such\").3J The seventh seminar, turned to by Copjec in her commentary on shame a la Lacan,32 enriches and extends these observations regardingpudeur. Lacan\\'s contemplations therein bearing on beauty playa key role in this vein: \"The true barrier that holds the subject back in front of the unspeakable field of radical desire that is the field of absolute destruction, of destruction beyond tion, is properly speaking the aesthetic phenomenon where it is identified with· the experience of beauty-beauty in all its shining radiance, beauty that has been called the splendor of truth. It is obviously because truth is not pretty to look at that beauty is, if not its splendor, then at least its envelope.\"33 In terms of Lac an\\'s preceding discussions of pudeur apropos the phallus, the ugly truth concealed by material and not-so-material veils is (symbolic) castration, the fact that there is nothing equal to the phallic fac;ade, nothing measuring up to this impossible standard. The curtains covering this bitter, distasteful ciency can use the ruses of aesthetic appeal, of decorative adornments, to hide or dress up any small, hairy disappointments, \\nwhoever or whatever they may be. Later on in the seventh seminar, Lacan links the \"limit\" of beauty as the barrier, curtain, envelope, or veil of truth to the specter of death: 34 \"I wanted to show you how the function of the Signifier in permitting the subject\\'s access to his relationship to death might be made more concrete than is possible through a connotation. That is why I have tried to have you recognize it in our recent meetings in an aesthetic form, namely, that of the beautiful-it being precisely the function \\nof the beautiful to reveal to us the site of man\\'s relationship to his own death, and to reveal it to us only in a blinding flash.\"35 Coming quickly on the heels of his commentary on Sophocles\\'s Antigone, one example of a \"blinding flash\" of beauty Lacan undoubtedly has in mind here is the fascinating dramatic-tragic figure of \"Antigone in her unbearable splendor.\"36 Another example that may be suitable in this context is the tion of Christ as a fetishized martyr associated with certain styles of cism in particular, a depiction lingering with obscene,jouissance-Iaden relish over every detail of his wounded bare body. In both cases, an aesthetic tion or sublimation of suffering unto death covers over doomed-to-rot sexed skin in the gleaming sheen of art\\'s mercifully distracting, cathartic pleasures. Lacan proceeds to draw parallels between beauty and shame. He begins this by noting: \"I should like to introduce here, as a parallel to the function \\nof the beautiful, another function. I have named it on a number of occasions without emphasizing it particularly, but it seems to me essential to refer to it here. It 160 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'is with your permission what I shall call or, in other words, a sense of shame. The omission of this barrier, which prevents the direct experience of that which is to be found at the center of sexual union, seems to me to be at the origin of all kinds of questions that cannot be answered.\"37The shame at stake here is again pudeur.38 At first, one might think that, for Lacan, shame is to sex what beauty is to death: just as beauty shields the mortal subject from the blunt, unmitigated experiential effects (or affects) of facing the ugly truth of its own unglorious mortality with no fantasmatic embellishments and illusions, so too is shame something that \"prevents the direct experience of that which is to be found at the center of sexual union\" (or, as Lacan later puts it, pudeur as a modest restraint shields one from the truth that \"it n\\'y a pas de rapport sexuel. \")39 But, additional remarks in both the seventh seminar and subsequent contexts indicate that Lacan, in good Freudian fashion, refuses to partition sex and death as two cleanly distinct topics, thus problematizing the neat tion of when they are correlated to shame and beauty, respectively. Soon after comparing beauty and shame as parallel defensive both serve in protective capacities relative to painful facts4°-Lacan asks, \"Do the fantasm of the phallus and the beauty of the human image find their legitimate place at the same level?\"41 Arguably, this is a rhetorical question, the answer to which is \"Yes.\" Why? For Freudian-Lacanian psychoanalysis, sex and death are mutually entangled in multiple manners. In connection with this, the aesthetics of phallic sexuality require repressing from view, through the artful manipulation of veils Qf various sorts, an underbelly of time-ravaged, cent flesh spitting out spluttering trickles of smelly discharges. Even when two sexual partners face each other in their apparent nakedness, a nakedness which really isn\\'t so naked thanks to the interplay of fantasmatic projections between them,42 each must unknowingly coat both bodies there in layers of fantasies making possible the effect or affect of sexiness. The masquerades of such fantasy-supported sexuality wrap titillating films of spectral images and meanings around a repulsively rotten core of senseless filth, of idiotic, pointless enjoyment driven along by the raw facticity of a sexuality coupled with ity.43 In later seminars, Lacan indeed speaks of pudeur vis-a.-vis the anxieties and horrors of the faceless Real of death-tinged sexuality.44 If Lacanian pudeur (over and above honte qua Empjindung, the felt feeling of shame as embarrassment, humiliation, and so on) is qualified as something affective, then the truly subtle dimensions of Lacan\\'s underdeveloped, largely tacit metapsychology of affect present a much more intricate picture than is commonly assumed by the majority of his readers.

Again, if pudeur is affective, then the Lacanian unconscious is not without affect. But, this remains quite vague insofar as it raises a series of yet-to-be-answered questions, questions Lacan himself doesn\\'t explicitly address: Is the distinction between honte and pudeur to be lined up in a way that corresponds to the distinction between actual and potential affects, respectively? Can honte or pudeur be misfelt, that is, consciously tered and reflexively interpreted as affective hues other than themselves? larly but differently, can honte or pudeur be enlisted in intra-affective defensive maneuvers in which one consciously feels ashamed or modest so as to avoid feeling other possible feelings instead, in which case these defended-against other (potential) feelings would be, in a certain sense, unconscious? The most effective and productive way to handle these difficulties bequeathed to temporary thought by Freud and Lacan is to interface their metapsychologies with the neurosciences. Some of Zizek\\'s recent work constructs a very useful and unconventional bridge between Lacanian psychoanalytic theory and neuroscientific accounts of emotional life and affective selfhood or subjectivity. Interestingly, there is evidence that Zizek admits the existence of unconscious affects, a controversial admission in psychoanalysis generally and Lacanianism especially. On at least one occasion, he speaks of guilt, in faithful Freudian fashion, as \"ultimately unconscious:\\'45 In this context, he even indicates two modes in which guilt can be unconscious: (I) \"the subject is unaware of his or her guilt\" (i.e., an unfelt feeling), and (2) \"he or she, while experiencing the pressure of guilt, is unaware of what he or she is guilty of\" (i.e., an enigmatic, free-floating feeling).46 The latter mode arguably also could be (or morph into) a misfelt feeling: in the absence of an explicit cognizance of culpability apropos a misdeed relative to a certain rule, the feeling that might otherwise be self-interpretively felt as guilt is consciously registered as some other affective tonality (such as anxiety, vousness, vague discomfort, or even physical illness). Zizek\\'s book The Parallax View (published in 2006) contains detailed engagements with the sciences of the brain. Among other figures in this set of disciplines, he turns his attention to Damasio in particular, specifically the latter\\'s neuroscience-based theories of emotional matters elaborated primarily in the book The Feeling o/What Happens (published in 1999). Before turning 162 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'to what has to say a few remarks should be made abour the ideas and of the latter. To with, Damasio is generally to psychoanalysis and pathetic to the neuro-psychoanalytic movement in Anglo-American clinical analytic circles; for instance, he sits on the Neuroscience Editorial Advisory Board of the journal Neuro-Psychoanalysis, of which Solms is one of the ing editors.47 Damasio (and, in fact, neuroscience as a whole) fundamentally accepts an unconscious along the lines of that described by analytic chology.48 What\\'s more, whereas the notion of unconscious affect remains troversial in certain sectors of psychoanalysis-for many Lacanians, the phrase \"unconscious affect\" is oxymoronic-Damasio (and, as will be seen, many of his fellow researchers investigating the emotional brain) posits the reality of affective phenomena below the threshold of self-awareness.49 Like Freud, he even acknowledges the ostensibly unavoidable awkwardness of proposing that there are feelings that aren\\'t felt as such: \"Someone may suggest that perhaps we should have another word for \\'feelings that are not conscious: but there isn\\'t one.\"so In the three shadows cast by Freud, Lacan, and Zizek, the current sion, with its selective focus, will be limited to touching upon Damasio\\'s ion of distinguishing between \"emotions\" and \"feelings\" (as well as between nonconscious and conscious feelings). Properly understanding this Damasian distinction requires initially noting that Damasio insists, as I\\'ve done here too, on the essentially mediated nature of human beings\\' affective lives, on the ineliminable modulation (even constitution) of passions and sentiments by intellectual, linguistic, and representational configurations.sl To put it in the language of the neuroscience trinity of cognition, emotion, \\nand motivation, the emotional brain cannot be separated from the cognitive brains2 (not to mention the motivational brain, whose facets also are of great importance to psychoanalysis, with its reliance on a theory of drives). For Damasio, emotions are, by his definition, non conscious phenomena, rather than, as in quotidian parlance, felt feelings. To be more precise, asian emotions are phYSiological processes visible to third-party observers; feelings, by contrast, are private, first-person phenomena.53 He thus aligns emotions with the publicly accessible body and feelings with the publicly cessible mind.s4 However, Damasio is far from resting content with an fensibly simplistic opposition between a non conscious body of phYSiological emotions and a conscious mind of psychological feelings. This becomes clear in Damasio\\'s delineation of a three-stage diachronic sequence running from EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN ',\n",
       " 'and conscious emo-tions \"I separate three stages of pro-cessing along a continuum: state which can be triggered and executed nonconsciously; a state of fleling, which can be represented sciously; and a state offoeling made conscious, i.e., known to the organism ing both emotion and feeling.\"56 The second of these three stages is where Damasio is perhaps at his most psychoanalytic. On his account, the human brain is a compulsive, reflexive modeler, constantly generating map-like depictions of the states of the subject\\'s body, its world of objects, and the ongoing interactions between these two enmeshed poles (with consciousness being an outgrowth of these self-mapping dynamics).5? The conceptions and pictures thus formed can be, in Damasio\\'s view, either conscious or nonconscious.58 He\\'s entirely open about his reliance on the (originally Freudian) assertion according to which the large domain of mental life that isn\\'t conscious contains not only motivational energies and impulses (as per the pseudo-Freudian notion of the unconscious as the dark depths of a writhing, primordial animal id), but also cognitive images and representations (something Lacan adamantly insists upon again and again in his \"return to Freud\"): \"Images may be conscious or unconscious. It should be noted, however, that not all the images the brain constructs are made conscious. There are simply too many images being generated and too much competition for the relatively small window of mind in which images can be made conscious-the window, that is, in which images are accompanied by a sense that we are apprehending them and that, as a consequence, are erly attended. In other words, metaphorically speaking, there is indeed a terranean underneath the conscious mind and there are many levels to that subterranean.\"59 With the preceding details in mind, a better appreciation of the nuances and potentials of Damasio\\'s fine-grained distinctions concerning affective life is now possible. Damasio states: \"This perspective on emotion, feeling, and knowing is unorthodox. First, I am suggesting that there is no tral feeling state before the respective emotion occurs, that expression tion) precedes feeling. Second, I am suggesting that \\'having a feeling\\' is not the same as \\'knowing a feeling: that reflection on feeling is yet another step up. Overall, this curious situation reminds me ofE. M. Forster\\'s words: \\'How can I know what I think before I say it ?\"\\'60 Emotions are \"expressions\" in the sense of physiological processes fested by the body (everything from heart rates and adrenalin releases to ing and sweating). These bodily states then are cognitively mapped, translated MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'into Such maps of emotions, constructed the spontaneous activities of a brain that \"is the cap-rive audience;\\'61 be feelings in Damasio\\'s However, he stipulates that feelings thus defined are not automatically and necessarily scious (i.e., consciously felt feelings, Freudian Empfindungen). As Damasio postulates, one can \"have a feeling\" (as a non conscious or unconscious image or representation of an emotion qua physiological condition) without ing it.62 (Jean-Pierre Changeux, another neuroscientist, likewise observes that \"the direct experience of feeling is readily distinguished from the knowledge that one has a feeling.\")63 And, perhaps there are two modes in which this gap between having and knowing can exist: on the one hand, the feeling is tended to by first-person consciousness (i.e., it\\'s an unfelt feeling), or, on the other hand, the feeling is interpreted by first-person consciousness (i.e., it\\'s a misfelt feeling, examples of which might include the conscious registration of varieties of affective excitation as anxiety or of guilt as physical distress). At this point, it\\'s tempting to establish one-to-one correspondences between the affective trinities of Freud and Damasio: Ajfekt (affect) is emotion (for choanalysis, this emotionally expressive body is already itself saturated by the denaturalizing influences of intertwined cognitive-ideational and tional-libidinal dimensions); Gefuhl (emotion) is feeling-had (which can be unconscious, as in unconscious gUilt it la Freud [unbewujSte SchuldgifUhlJ); and Empjindung (feeling) is feeling-known (which would be \"feeling\" in the everyday, nontechnical sense of the word). Damasio\\'s work on affective life should be of great interest for sis, including even Lacanian theory. (ZiZek once more, as in other respects too, is an admirable and rare exception, being one of the all-too-few Lacanians to address seriously the advances achieved by Damasio and the neurosciences as a whole; by contrast, Anglo-American neuro-psychoanalysis indeed has siastically embraced affective neuroscience.) From a Freudian-Lacanian spective, several features of the approach to parsing the affective phenomena selectively summarized immediately strike the eye. As in Freudian chology, Damasio\\'s intermediary realm of feelings-had, situated in a ing capacity between nonconscious emotions and conscious feelings-known, consists of Triebreprasentanzen (drive representatives), namely, the cal inscriptions both structurally articulated and energetically charged that form the coordinates of the drives\\' aims (Ziele) and objects (Objekte). Along related Lacanian lines, one cannot help but think of jouis-sens, of the hybrid juxtapositions and unstable syntheses of (in Freud\\'s terms) soma and psyche, EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł 165 ',\n",
       " 'of something neither strictly corporeal-libidinal nor subjective-meaningfu1.64 Additionally, the line from Forster quoted by Damasio also elegantly sulates Lacan\\'s take on an aspect of free association in the analytic process, a take in which the analysand, as a parletre voicing his/her thoughts and desires, comes to figure out what he/she really thinks and wants through the verbal labor of associational expression itself (rather than a take in which free tion merely helps to reveal what already was present beforehand fully formed in the repressed recesses of the speaking subject\\'s psyche).65 Before turning to Zizek\\'s critical comments on Damasio, a quick tion of the latter\\'s book Lookingfor Spinoza, published in 2003, promises to be helpful and relevant (in part because it further clarifies arguments and cepts first delineated in 1he Feeling of What Happens). Damasio\\'s Spinozism is expressed via the assertion, taken straight from part 2 of the Ethics (especially propositions 13 and 23), that \"the human mind is the idea of the human body.\"66 For Damasio, an obvious extension of this, in connection with his distinction between emotions and feelings, is the proposition that \"feelings ... are mostly shadows of the external manner of emotions:\\'67 Again, emotions are \"external\" insofar as they are corporeal expressions made manifest as physiological nomena potentially if not actually observable by third parties. Moreover, as indicated, they are, in and of themselves, nonconscious; they can be translated into consciously registered experiences in the guise of feelings, but they aren\\'t automatically and necessarily thus registered. In this vein, Damasio this observation obviously dovetails with assertions central to Freudian analysis-that pleasure and pain (as emotion-level bodily events) don\\'t need the mediation of conscious experience to generate and guide behaviors.68 He goes on to indicate that this independence relative to consciousness is enjoyed by emotions generally.69 Damasio, in line with the thesis that the mind consists of ideational tions of the body, defines feelings (as mental, distinct from physical, emotions) as representations of body-states (i.e., the body\\'s changing conditions and its ongoing interactions with entities and circumstances affecting it)?O He ceeds to elaborate: \"Feelings are perceptions, and I propose that the most essary support for their perception occurs in the brain\\'s body maps. These maps refer to parts of the body and states of the body. Some variation of pleasure or pain is a consistent content of the perception we call feeling.\"71 He continues: Alongside the perception of the body there is the perception of thoughts with themes consonant with the emotion, and a perception of a certain mode of 166 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'of me mal How does this \"\"\" ... come abour? It results from of our own mental process, a operation in which a part of the mind represents another part of the mind. This allows us to register the fact thilt our thoughts slow down or speed up as more or less attention is devoted to them; or the fact that thoughts depict objects and events at close range or at a distance, My hypothesis, then, presented in the form of a provisional definition, is that a feeling is the tion of a certain state of the body along with the perception of a certain mode of thinking and of thoughts with certain themes. Feelings emerge when the sheer accumulation of mapped details reaches a certain stage.72 As Damasio summarizes all of this a few pages later, \"A feeling of tion is an idea of the body when it is perturbed by the emoting process.\"73 From a psychoanalytic angle, a number of details in these passages warrant commentary. As I suggested earlier, the pleasure-and-pain-infused \"body maps;\\' themselves not necessarily conscious but capable of becoming so in the trappings of the ideational-representational material of feelings, can be associated with Freudian drive representatives (composing configurations of libidinal aims and objects) and Lacanian jouis-sens (itself written in the fluid \"language\" of lalangue). These Damasian maps, continually drafted and updated by the perpetual self-modeling activity of the brain, are essary-but-not-sufUcient conditions for the experience of somatic emotions as psychical felt feelings: \"an entity capable of feeling must be an ism that not only has a body but also a means to represent that body inside itself.\"74 What\\'s more, this mapping process is the first step of a two-step translation process at the end of which emerge feelings-known ungen), affective phenomena consciously experienced. In addition to the initial step from emotions to maps as (proto )affective formations (a step in which representations of body parts and relations with exogenous objects must be integrated), a subsequent step from such maps to tions\" (in which cognitive styles and contents must be linked and sized) is requisite for the genesis of a consciously felt feeling?S Although Damasio repeatedly acknowledges that something like the psychoanalytic unconscious plays a role in the vicissitudes of affective life,76 his discussions of the trajectories of translation leading from emotions through had to feelings-known tend to pass over quickly and quietly features of this multistep movement with respect to which a Freudian-Lacanian chology of affect has \\na lot to say. EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN ',\n",
       " 'The Lacanian rendition of the Freudian unconscious as at in twists, turns, and gaps inscribed within rhe surface of consciousness is worth recalling at this is well known, Lacan is adamantly opposed to the vulgar depiction of psychoanalysis as a hermeneutic depth psychology, an exploration of hidden pockets of profound meaning.)77 To be more precise, the psychoanalytic unconscious (and not the vague analytic notion of the nonconscious) exists, in part, as events of interventions intervening between different components and operations along the line ning from one end ofDamasio\\'s affective spectrum to the other, from scious emotions to conscious feelings. In other words, the unconscious isn\\'t itself a deep, obfuscated component or operation of the complex ensemble of affective machinery, but instead is something slipping into the intervals of spacing distinguishing emotions, feelings-had, and feelings-known. It even can and does affect the linkings internal to both feelings-had and feelings-known, that is, the linkings of body parts, states, and surrounding circumstances in Damasian feelings-had (i.e., first-order representations in the form of body maps mapping the far-from-elementary complexes that are emotions) as well as the linkings of cognitive modes and themes in Damasian feelings-known (i.e., second-order \"metarepresentations\" as reflective appreciations of affective experiences ). Put differently and more generally, the unconscious of intrapsychical defense mechanisms (i.e., the unconscious that is repressed, with \"repression\" to be taken here in its broadest possible analytic sense) is not reducible to any set of particular content-nodes in the networks of the psyche insofar as it cally slides between these nodes. Repression often bears on associative relations between pieces of psychical content. For example, in an analysis, an analysand might very well be able consciously to recollect every specific fragment of mnemic material involved in a given constellation underpinning a particular symptom. In such a case, what is repressed isn\\'t one memory among others, but instead the web of associations woven between the memories ing nodes in the network producing symptoms as its outgrowths. The relations between memories are repressed, rather than the memories themselves. The unconscious comes to light in such analytic circumstances as newly recognized connections between previously recognized contents. Whereas Damasio speaks of organic \"consonances\" between the different layers and levels of his affective spectrum, a psychoanalytic approach, taking up his model, would prefer to emphasize dissonances.

Additionally, this analytic metapsychological supplement to Damasio\\'s theory rectifies what appears to be one of its shortcomings: asio seems to suggest entertaining the unconvincing hypothesis that a simple, straightforward quantitative factor is responsible for the qualitative shift from nonconscious affective mechanisms to felt affective qualia (\"Feelings emerge when the sheer accumulation of mapped details reaches a certain stage\"). By contrast, an analytic approach would speculate that much more than \"sheer\" quantity alone is at work here. In several contexts, Damasio somewhat enigmatically refers to what he characterizes as \"feelings of feelings.\"78 At this point, an examination ofZiZek\\'s Lacanian criticisms of Damasio\\'s account of affective life is appropriate and promises to be productive. Zizek devotes a certain amount of attention to a topic I did not delve into earlier, namely, the theory of the multiple degrees and strata of consciousness and selfhood in Ihe Feeling of What Happens (in which Damasio sets out such conceptual categories as protoselfhood, core sciousness or selfhood, extended consciousness, autobiographical selfhood, and conscience),79 On this score, Zizek\\'s complaint is that reducing ity to the two dimensions of embodied being (as protoselfhood and core sciousness or selfhood) and linguistic-representational identity (as extended consciousness, autobiographical selfhood, and conscience) leaves out the third dimension first isolated by Descartes in the figure of the Cogito (i.e., the subject proper as the emptiness of the negativity of $, Lacan\\'s \"barred subject\\',):8o Damasio\\'s solution to the old enigma of the two sides of Self (Self qua the continuously changing stream of consciousness verses Self qua the permanent stable core of our subjectivity) misses the mark: \"the seemingly changing self and the seemingly permanent self, although closely related, are not one entity but two\" -the first being the Core Self, the second the autobiographical Self There is no place here, however, for what we as speaking beings experience (or, rather, presuppose) as the empty core of our subjectivity: what am I? I am neither my body (I have a body, I never \"am\" my body directly, in spite of all the subtle phenomenological descriptions a la Merleau-Ponry that try to convince me to the contrary), nor the stable core of my autobiographical narratives that form my symbolic identity; what \"I am\" is the pure One of an empty Self which remains the same One throughout the constant change EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN ',\n",
       " 'of autobiographical narratives. This One is engendered by language: it is ther the Core Self nor the autobiographical Self, but what the Core Self is transubstantiated (or, rather, desubstantialized) into when it is transposed into language. This is what Kant has in mind when he distinguishes between the \"person\" (the wealth of autobiographical content that provides tial content to my Self) and the pure subject of transcendental apperception which is just an empty point of self-relating.81 The entire philosophical framework informing this critique ofDamasio not be exhaustively elucidated here insofar as this would require reconstructing the entirety of the Zizekian theory of subjectivity, which is constructed at the intersection of German idealism and Lacanian psychoanalysis (a tion I carry out in my book Zizek\\'s Ontology: A Transcendental Materialist Theory of Subjectivity, published in 2008). But, what\\'s crucial in this context is Zizek\\'s insistence, following Lacan, that Symbolic mediation (i.e., the sage of the substantial protosubject into the enveloping milieus of language structures) creates a subject (i.e., the Cogito-like central to tian and post-Kantian German idealism) that thereafter escapes reduction to either bodily nature (including Damasio\\'s \"Core Self\") or linguistic culture (including Damasio\\'s \"autobiographical Self\"); this could be described as a sort of immanent structural genesis of transstructural subjectivity.82 Damasio agrees with Zizek about the invalidity of reducing consciousness or selfhood to language;83 he even speculates that nonhuman animals have cal selves, thereby clearly indicating that he doesn\\'t consider this stratum of selfhood to be entirely language-bound.84 But, Damasio and Zizek certainly seem to part company apropos the latter\\'s Lacanian thesis that the corporeal. substance of the Damasian protoselves and core selves doesn\\'t remain a purely biological foundation over which is then subsequently laid utterly separate and distinct higher-order mental scaffoldings. (Lurking in the broadest passing background is what would be a much more far-reaching, fundamental debate about the extent to which sociosymbolic mediators penetrate and alter the realities of the body.) In The Feeling of What Happens, Damasio does concede that a certain amount of dialectical interaction transpires between core consciousness or selfhood and the additional tiers of different configurations of ness/selfhood overlaid on top ofit.85 And yet, Zizek is quite right that sio nonetheless tends to stick perSistently to the claim that an atomic center of substantial biomaterial being utterly untouched by nonnatural influences 170 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'remains a pure, all other dimensions of mental life. 86 Against this asserts that insertion into ico-linguistic matrices of mediation in Lacanese, the submission of the protosubject S to \"symbolic castration\" by the big Other, thus producing the subject-as-$) \"transubstantiates\" and \"desubstantializes\" the Damasian hard kernel of bodily existence. However, Zizek\\'s critique ignores Damasio\\'s tinction between the protoself and the core self, conflating these two entities under the single heading of the \"Core Self.\" For Damasio, the core self is a representational map of the protoself.87 Nonetheless, in the spirit of Zizek\\'s psychoanalytically inspired objection to Damasio, it would be justifiable to maintain that the advent of language use (especially the subjectifying sition of proficiency with proper names and personal pronouns) might substantiate\" the very means and results of the translation process leading from the protoself to the core self. Put in combined Lacanian and Damasian vocabularies, an irreparable rift rendering all representational translation between the protoself as S and the core self as $ somewhat misrepresentative (a la Lacan\\'s meconnaissance) may open like a gaping wound in organisms subjected to the cutting intervention of linguistic structures. This would be the initial, zero-level introduction into the corporeal reality of human animals of the dissonances and discrepancies that come to be characteristic of split speaking subjects through whose splits culate unconscious dimensions. But, whereas Zizek sounds as though he flirts at this moment with a vaguely social-constructivist vision according to which the nature-based protoself-as-S is retroactively liquidated and replaced by the language-induced core-self-as-$ (now in the form of the Hegelian-Lacanian void of self-relating negativity), what I am proposing ently is an alternative picture in which, to articulate this in Hegelian fashion, the distinction between S (as the protoself) and $ (as the core self) persists as a distinction internal to $ itself. That is to say, not only do chasms of varying widths crack open between the language-independent protoself as S and its (un)representational (mis ) translations in and by the linguistically influenced core self as $, but a split within the core-self-as-$ mirrors this chasm, a split dividing the core self in two, into both a plastic avatar of substantial bodily being as well as a faceless blank of de substantialized negativity. In other words, maybe there are two core selves dissonant with each other (in addition to the varyingly dissonant intervals between protoselves and core selves): a \"full\" core self and an \"empty\" core self (the latter being the Cogito-like void of interest to Zizek, something admittedly neglected by Damasio).

Anxiety as correlative to confronting the Void that forms the core of the subject; horror as the experience of disgusting life at its purest, \\'undead\\' life:\\'89 What sio depicts as natural (i.e., the core self as the source of not-felt or not-yet-felt emotions) Zizek treats as radically antinatural, that is \"no longer ... contained within the frame oflife-homeostasis, ... no longer constrained by the cal machinery oflife-regulation\" (i.e., $, which is also the Lacanian subject of the unconscious, as itself a generator of affective phenomena). By arguing that \"emotions are already the subject\\'s;\\' he signals his hypothesis that Damasio\\'s proto self or core self (or, more accurately, selves) is thoroughly denaturalized apres-coup by the intrusion of the signifiers of the symbolic order. Of course, one might have reservations with respect to what sounds like a hyperbolic positing of a total and complete denaturalization without reserve or remainder. As regards the (human) \"nature\" underpinning subjectivity, I prefer to conceive of denaturalization as, at least in some circumstances, more of a sedimentary accumulation, a layering of heterogeneous montages of often flicting dimensions running the gamut from the relatively \"natural\" (e.g., tionary tendencies rooted in archaic environmental contexts) to the relatively \"nonnatural\" (primarily sociohistorical factors and variables past and present). To misappropriate some ofZizek\\'s language from In Defense of Lost Causes,90 the whole problem is that \"life 2.0\" (i.e., the retroactive denaturalizer oflife as 172 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

At least in certain cases, the latter continues to operate in parallel with the former, with antagonisms and dysfunctions arising between them. Human beings, in terms of where they stand between the natural and the nonnatural, could be described as creatures of temporal torsions. Parts of human beings lag behind in the time warp of evolutionary-genetic influences linked to long-past contexts, whereas other parts, which can and do come into conflict with these same evolutionary-genetic influences, take shape according to faster-moving historical temporalities. (Moreover, the latter are themselves outgrowths of evolution that have escaped control by evolutionary governance alone.)91 Such beings are the products of incomplete, partial denaturalizations failing to eliminate without undigested leftovers the vestiges of things other than the sociosymbolically mediated structures and phenomena of human tory both phylogenetic and ontogenetic. Of course, one should edly agree with Zizek that \"Nature does not exist\" if \"Nature\" designates a balanced, harmonious One-All; this is another nonexistent big Other (as per Lacan\\'s \"Le grand Autre n\\'existe pas\").92 However, nature indeed does exist both as that which immanently allows for and generates the denaturalizations involved with subjectivity,93 and as a bundle of anachronistic variables, within the substance of human being, out of joint with various and sundry aspects of more current historical-temporal milieus. Nature is a participant in this anced ensemble of conflicting elements. So, to paraphrase Lacan\\'s \"there is no Other of the Other\" (rather than his \"the big Other does not exist\"), I assert that there is no Nature of nature, although there is nature as fragmentary, sundering components caught up in the conflicts constitutive of the \"human condition.\"94 Regardless of all this, Zizek\\'s crucial move in the passages quoted three graphs earlier is his insightful proposal that the signifier-catalyzed explosion of the emptiness of $ out of the fullness of 5, of (as per Hegel) subject proper out of substance, is not without significant repercussions in the spheres of affect. In fact, for Zizek, properly human-subjective affects are neither emotions nor feelings in Damasio\\'s senses of these latter two terms. Damasio treats tions as automatic phYSiological processes regulated by nonconscious bodily mechanisms, although he stipulates that the translation of emotions into sciously registered feelings allows for partial cognitive-intellectual mediation and modulation of embodied emotions.95 By contrast, Zizek, for a number of EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł 173 ',\n",
       " 'Freudian-Lacanian reasons, insists that the emoting body, insinuated by sio to rest on a natural or instinctual basis, is altered right down to its bare bones and raw flesh by its trans formative insertion into the sociosymbolic matrices of the big Other. (First and foremost, the corporeal core self of Damasio is substantiated\" and \"denaturalized\" into the disembodied emptiness of Lac an\\'s Cogito-like $, a void linked to such linguistic signifier-entities as proper names and personal pronouns.)96 Zizek proceeds to refer to LeDoux, another major researcher in the field of affective neuroscience, best known for his empirical investigations of the role of the amygdala in generating fear, in extending his critique ofDamasio: It would be interesting to conceive the very specificity of \"being-human\" as grounded in this gap between cognitive and emotional abilities: a human being in whom emotions were to catch up with cognitive abilities would no longer be human, but a cold monster deprived of human emotions .... Here we should supplement LeDoux with a more structural approach: it is not ply that our emotions lag behind our cognitive abilities, stuck at the primitive animal level; this very gap itself functions as an \"emotional\" foct, giving rise to new, specifically human, emotions, from anxiety (as opposed to mere fear) to (human) love and melancholy. Is it that LeDoux (and Damasio, on whom LeDoux relies here) misses this feature because of the fundamental ness (or, rather, ambiguity) of the proto-Althusserian distinction between emotions and feelings? This distinction has a clear Pascalian twist (and it is a mystery that, in his extensive critique of \"Descartes\\' error,\" Damasio does not evoke Pascal, Descartes\\'s major critic): physical emotions do not display inner feelings but, on the contrary, generate them. However, there is thing missing here: a gap between emotions qua biological-organic bodily tures and emotions qua learned symbolic gestures following rules (like Pascal\\'s kneeling and praying). Specifically \"human\" emotions (like anxiety) arise only when a human animal loses its emotional mooring in biological instincts, and this loss is supplemented by the symbolically regulated emotions qua man\\'s \"second nature.\"97 Indeed, LeDoux, like Damasio, sees neuroscience and psychoanalysis as far from incompatible. Moreover, like the Lacanian Zizek, he emphasizes the reaching \"revolutionary\" (rather than just \"evolutionary; smooth, and gradual) ramifications for the human animal of its immersion in language, an sion changing and reshaping brains and bodies.98 (Damasio similarly speaks 174 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

From a psychoanalytic perspective, perhaps one of the most important facts emphasized by LeDoux is that, as it might be expressed, the brain, although a bodily organ, is not organic in such a way that it is a piece of nature that is a harmonious and synthesized self-integrated system of balanced components in sync with each other.IOl In fact, LeDoux points to precisely the sort of nomena that led Freud to posit the centrality in mental life of intrapsychical conflicts and Lacan to invoke again and again the figure of the split subject as evidence of the brain\\'s hodgepodge, collage-like construction, a tion whose mismatched elements don\\'t necessarily work well together.102 Along these lines, in his study The Emotional Brain, he observes: \"Although we often talk about the brain as if it has a function, the brain itself actually has no tion. It is a collection of systems, sometimes called modules, each with different functions. There is no equation by which the combination of functions of all the different systems mixed together equals an additional function called brain function.\"103 He goes on to add, \"Evolution tends to act on the individual ules and their functions rather than the brain as a whole .... [BJy and large most evolutionary changes in the brain take place at the level of individual ules.\"104 The brain, like the rest of the human body with which it\\'s inseparably enmeshed, is a product not of Evolution with a capital E (itself yet another nonexistent Lacanian big Other), but of a plethora of different and distinct evolutionary circumstances and challenges spread out over a disparate number of times and places (as Damasio puts it, \"Evolution is not the Great Chain of Being\").IOS In this vein, Alain Badiou\\'s denial of Nature as a monolithic cosmic One-All and parallel corresponding affirmation of the existence of a tion of natural multiplicities-\"Nature has no sayable being. There are only some natural beings:\\'106-can and should be applied to the natural-scientific notion of evolution. Moreover, these evolutionary pressures, not at all dinated and unified with each other, act separately on a diverse array of pendent systems and subsystems within the central nervous system. (Damasio notes that \"the brain is a system of systems\"!07 and highlights the mismatch between brain stem and cortex in the human nervous system, two [sub J systems of different evolutionary age forced to cooperate with each other.)!08 No down design plan governed the assembly process producing the peculiar lump EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł 17 S ',\n",

Consequently, the resulting product of such a process is, not ingly, prone to an incalculable number of internal antagonisms, tensions, and short circuits. Or, as the neuroscientist David]. Linden describes it, the human central nervous system is a \"kludge\": \"The brain is ... a kludge, ... a design that is inefficient, inelegant, and unfathomable, but that nevertheless works\" 109 and \"at every turn, brain design has been a kludge, a workaround, a jumble, a pastiche:\\'llo Linden\\'s book 1he Accidental Mind, published in 2007, edly insists that the brain is inelegantly designed by a multitude of haphazard evolutionary tinkerings in which the newer is plopped on top of the tively older and, hence, is \"poorly organized;\\' \"a cobbled-together mess.\"lll (Incidentally, Linden devastatingly wields his kludge thesis against tion proponents of so-called intelligent design.)ll2 In the year immediately after the publication of Linden\\'s book, the psychologist Gary Marcus, in the book Kludge, analyzed a range of mental phenomena in light of the same basic thesis advanced by Linden.ll3 Both Linden\\'s and Marcus\\'s positions are foreshadowed by, among other sources, Jacob\\'s Science article \"Evolution and kering\" from 1977114 (a quotation from which serves as one of the epigraphs to Marcus\\'s book). One would have to be, as it were, utterly brainless not to see the importance of this neuroscientific picture of the material seat of ity for a psychoanalytic metapsychology \\nemphasizing the central structuring functions of conflicts in mental life. Clearly consistent with his stress upon the nonexistence of the Brain with a capital B as \"brain function\" in the singular-echoing Badiou, there is, within each human being, no Brain, only some brains-is LeDoux\\'s repeated and emphatic argument against the false impression that affective neuroscience can and does deal with emotional life in general or an ultimately homogenous tion function in the brain (such as the so-called limbic system, something the objective reality of which is a bone of contention among neuroscientists),us So, not only is there no coherent brain function overall, but there is no emotion function overall either (and, with reference again to the trinity of cognition, emotion, and motivation, one might wonder, under the influence of alytic thinking, whether the same might be said for cognitive and motivational functions too). In his substantial survey Affictive Neuroscience, Panksepp takes a further step along this same trajectory delineated by LeDoux (even though he and LeDoux disagree about the status of the notion of the limbic system),u6 Panksepp maintains that even particular individual emotions lack discrete 176 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

For this reason, modern neuroscientists talk about interacting \\'circuits: \\'networks: and \\'cell assemblies\\' rather than \\'centers.\"\\'117 Combining LeDoux\\'s denial of a basic, general emotion function in the brain with Panksepp\\'s denial of compartmentalized anatomical brain loci related in a one-to-one manner with various feeling states, one can postulate the following: even specific singular emotions are complex (or complexes), that is, nonatomic or nonelementary clusters of interconnections between multiple different systems and subsystems in the brain. What\\'s more, it seems quite reasonable to suppose that all three dimensions of brain functioning (i.e., cognition, emotion, and motivation) come into play in affective phenomena. Panksepp says as much here. Moreover, elsewhere, he remarks that \"it must be kept in mind that the brain is a massively interconnected organ whose every part can find an access pathway to any other part.\"118 He subsequently links this fact to emotional phenomena, emphasizing that the brain\\'s mind-bogglingly intricate internal interconnectedness makes it such that emotions are cably intertwined with nonemotional dimensionsY9 Additionally, both within and between these interacting functions, it also seems defensible to esize that a plurality of separate strata of temporal layers deposited in the brain (deposits dating from natural-evolutionary times as well as nonnatural cal times) converge and clash throughout the neural interactions generating emotions, feelings, and the like. The big picture that arises from all of this, if indeed such a picture can be drawn on the basis of the preceding, is one that LeDoux appears to endorse. This endorsement is expressed in a passage that ZiZek undoubtedly has in mind when critically \"supplementing\" LeDoux\\'s ideas in The Parallax View: \"there is an imperfect set of connections between cognitive and emotional systems in the current stage of evolution of the human brain. This state of affairs is part of the price we pay for having newly evolved cognitive capacities that are not yet fully integrated into our brains. Although this is also a problem for other primates, it is particularly acute for humans, since the brain of our species, especially our cortex, was extensively rewired in the process of ing natural language functions.\"120 Zizek\\'s earlier-quoted comments on this EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł 177 ',\n",

Especially for a Lacanian, this lack (here a lack of coordination, harmonization, synthesis, and so on between different neurological functions) is positive as well as negative, a plus arising from a minus. And, like Lacan, LeDoux too identifies the cutting tion of language as largely responsible for the severity of the cracks and sures of desynchronization introduced into the human brain. Hence, Zizek, in consonance with a number of hypotheses recently put forward by various investigators into the brain,l2l speculates that in losing a presupposed prior lutionarily integrated balance of neurological functions, people gain their very humanness, their denaturalized subjectivity with its peculiar, uniquely human affective potentials. After formulating these observations in response to Damasio and LeDoux, Zizek proceeds to warn that one must mind \"the gap that separates the brain sciences\\' unconscious from the Freudian Unconscious.\"l22 He argues that this gap is particularly palpable as regards the topic of emotions.123 Other authors, such as Ansermet and Magistretti as well as Pommier, likewise caution against conflating the psychoanalytic unconscious with the unconscious often \\nspoken of by those situated in the neurosciences, with the latter frequently referring to what analysis would identify as merely preconscious or nonconscious (rather than unconscious proper in the sense of being defensively occluded by such intrapsychical mechanisms as repression, disavowal, negation, rejection or foreclosure, and so on)p4 Interestingly, LeDoux himself issues the exact same warning: \"Like Freud before them, cognitive scientists reject the view handed down from Descartes that mind and consciousness are the same. However, the cognitive unconscious is not the same as the Freudian or dynamic unconscious. The term cognitive unconscious merely implies that a lot of what the mind does goes on outside; of consciousness, whereas the dynamic unconscious is a darker, more malevolent place where emotionally charged memories are shipped to do mental dirty work. To some extent, the dynamic unconscious can be conceived in terms of cognitive processes, but the term cognitive unconscious does not imply these dynamic operations:\\'l25 Damasio too is aware of and acknowledges these crucial differences.l26 Zizek and certain other psychoanalytically inclined interpreters of the neurosciences are quite justified in being concerned that many neuroscientists carelessly and indefensibly conflate Freud\\'s unconscious with that of nonanalytic cognitive 178 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'science. H,-\"\",Ou?\\',. Damasio and the two neuroscientists mentioned name in the section of The View under consideration in the present context, are notable exceptions to this tendency in the neuroscientific ture. What\\'s more, although Zizek charges that Damasio problematically treats emotions (as distinct from feelings) as simply and straightforwardly natural in the sense of biologically hardwired-in his theory of the emotion-based self, Damasio indeed tends to speculate about a kernel of nature as the fixed tion for additional later layers of higher-order nurture 127 -there are moments when Damasio appears to entertain the possibility of sociosymbolic mediation penetrating all the way down into the bedrock of even the most rudimentary bodily emotional ground of human being.128 The issue of neuroscientific naturalism (such as Damasio\\'s, which is critiqued by Zizek) and its validity or invalidity vis-a-vis psychoanalysis will be returned to shortly. For the moment, four lines of thought in Damasio\\'s defense apropos his alleged failure to account for the properly Freudian unconscious ought to be advanced. First, if the conclusions reached by my prior reexamination of the treatments of affective phenomena in Freud are correct, then the mutually exclusive contrast Zizek appeals to between an emotional unconscious and the Freudian unconscious is questionable, if not incorrect (for the same reasons that render problematic Lacan\\'s dogmatic insistence that Freud flatly denies the existence of unconscious affects, an insistence upon which Zizek, at least in The Parallax View, evidently relies). Second, despite his general, prevailing emphasis upon the naturalness of the rudimentary emotional building blocks of the embodied human mind, Damasio (as I already have indicated) less occasionally allows for the possibility of cognitive (and, hence, linguistic) mediation and modulation even of physiological emotions, not just of psychologically parsed feelings. Third, Damasio\\'s distinction between emotions and feelings, rather than threatening to reduce the unconscious to a roiling carnal sea of primitive impulses and passions (in a fashion counter to Freudian-Lacanian psychoanalysis), both dovetails with key features of Lac an\\'s depiction of the unconscious and opens up new options for envisioning this set of mental dimensions central to psychoanalytic concerns. As regards this third line of defense, Lacan continually combats the crude popular image of the unconscious as a dark, hidden depth, repeatedly taining (sometimes with recourse to topology, the mathematical science of surfaces) that the unconscious is, so to speak, profoundly superficial, situated right out in the open of the signifiers and structures within which subjects come to be and circulate.129 Although Damasio, with respect to the topic of EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LAC AN Ł 179 ',\n",
       " 'the unconscious, indeed often does focus on emotions as deep corporeal states of a naturally shaped body overlooked by conscious mental attention (i.e., as unfelt emotions), his distinction between emotions and feelings nonetheless implies a notion of the unconscious that is anything but complicit with the woefully unsophisticated picture thinking of old versions of depth ogy. The Damasian unconscious consists not so much of unfelt emotions bubbling away in the obscure, opaque depths of the flesh, but instead of the ensemble of intervening mechanisms and processes facilitating and ing with the connections between emotions and feelings. In other words, Damasio\\'s unconscious, like that of Lacan, is a thin, in-between function of gaps, the cause of discrepancies and splits between manifest features of the parletre. In this vein, it\\'s important to recall that Damasio portrays emotions as public rather than private phenomena.l3O That is to say, emotional states, as corporeal events, are observable, at least in principle, by third parties, whether these third parties be scientists monitoring physiological changes in a human organism or nonscientific others taking stock of visible alterations expressed in and through the observed body of the person under consideration. (This is by contrast with feelings as mental events that, due to their first-person quality and corresponding experiential inaccessibility to other minds, can be \"observed\" only indirectly through linguistically conveyed reports.) So, an emotion a la Damasio, even if unfelt by the person whose body undergoes (un)said emotion, isn\\'t associated by him with concealed depths. the contrary: A Damasian emotion tends to be just as \"out there\" in the light of publicly visible day as the utterances spoken by the speaking subject. Along related lines, the Damasian unconscious subsists in the intervals between two types of manifestations: emotions as bodily conditions and thoughts as mental contents (which are potentially expressible in sociosymbolic terms, if not actually thus expressed). Thanks to these intervals as gaps between fested emotions and their equally manifested translations, nontranslations, or mistranslations in ideationally inflected mediums-such intervals should be counted as constituting some of the \"bars\" barring the split subject ($) of Lacanian theory-emotions can be not only unfelt but also misfelt in any number of manners. The fourth line of defense in favor of Damasio when faced with Zizek\\'s criticisms requires circumnavigating back to the question of naturalism versus antinaturalism. The position I\\'m staking out here in response to this tion could be succinctly encapsulated in Zizekian style as \"Naturalism or naturalism? No, thanks-both are worse!\"l31 Zizek closes the section of the ISO. MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'fourth chapter of The View dealing with Damasio, a section entitled \"Emotions or, Where Damasio Is \\\\Vrong,\" by insisting that we should bear in mind the basic anti-Darwinian lesson of psychoanalysis repeatedly emphasized by Lacan: man\\'s radical and fundamental tation, mal-adaptation, to his environs. At its most radical, \"being-human\" consists in an \"uncoupling\" from immersion in one\\'s environs, in following a certain automatism which ignores the demands of adaptation-this is what the \"death drive\" ultimately amounts to. Psychoanalysis is not \"deterministic\" (\"What I do is determined by unconscious processes\"): the \"death drive\" as a self-sabotaging structure represents the minimum of freedom, of a ior uncoupled from the utilitarian-survivalist attitude. The \"death drive\" means that the organism is no longer fully determined by its environs, that it \"explodeslimplodes\" into a cycle of autonomous behavior.132 The invocation of the psychoanalytic notion of the death drive won\\'t be treated in detail here; I\\'ve addressed Zizek\\'s philosophical appropriation of the infamous Freudian Todestrieb at length elsewhere.133 What I will address at present are the ways in which Zizek contrasts Damasio\\'s naturalism with Lacan\\'s antinaturalism. Both in the passage just quoted and others from the same portion of The Parallax View, one could read Zitek\\'s remarks as referring to a partial, rather than a complete, denaturalization tic of human beings qua subjects (as indicated by the adverb \"fully\" in \"the organism is no longer fully determined by its environs\"). Interpreted in this manner, Zitek succeeds at resisting the temptation of an exaggerated Lacanian antinaturalism insofar as he presupposes that the primitive tions deposited within the base of humans\\' mammalian brains by archaic evolutionary conditions persist alongside sociosymbolic configurations and all the various subjectifying mediations they bring with them. Zizek\\'s move here gestures at the notion of humans being creatures of incomplete, petually unfinished transformations, monstrous abortions of the failed lations of a weak, anything-but-omnipotent dialectic incapable of digesting the animal bodies out of which it emerges without leaving behind remaining residual scraps. To resort to the lexicon of Marxism, this would be a dialectic of interminably \"uneven development.\" However, one also, perhaps less charitably, could construe Zizek as sioning a total and thorough denaturalization befalling those living entities transubstantiated into $s by being taken up into the networks and webs of EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł 181 ',\n",

In an essay entitled \"From objet a to Subtraction:\\' he indeed sounds as though he endorses an excessively extreme antinaturalism, esizing a denaturalization without remainder that is brought about by the cesses of subjectification affecting human beings (as he similarly sounds in the previously mentioned discussion of life 1.0 versus life 2.0 from In Definse of Lost Causes). In that essay, Zizek depicts \"Freud\\'s basic lesson\" as the idea that \"there is no \\'human animal: a human being is from its birth (and even before) torn out of the animal constraints, its instincts are \\'denaturalized: caught in the circularity of the (death-)drive, functioning \\'beyond the pleasure principle.\\'\"134 Subsequently, in the same paragraph of this text, he suggests: \"In a step ther, one should even venture that there is no animal tout court, if by \\'animal\\' we mean a living being fully fitting its environs: the lesson of Darwinism is that every harmonious balance in the exchange between an organism and its environs is a temporary fragile one, that it can explode at any moment; such a notion of animality as the balance disturbed by the human hubris is a human fantasy.\" 13S Without contesting in the least the accuracy of this interpretation of winian evolutionary theory, it ought to be noticed that Zizek appears partially to denaturalize nonhuman animals typically considered to be elements of \"nature,\" which is imagined as a balanced harmony. (Zizek\\'s larger body of osophical work, especially in terms of his materialist ontology and ing theory of subjectivity, compels a radical rethinking of the protoconceptual pictures and metaphors constituting the images of nature informing standard varieties of naturalism.) 136 And although he partially denaturalizes nonhuman animals, he completely denaturalizes human animals, depicting such beings as always already \"torn out of\" their biological, instinctual animality. Although Damasio unambiguously evinces naturalist sympathies problematic from an orthodox Lacanian point of view, he and his like-minded brain researchers (such as LeDoux, Panksepp, and Keith Stanovich) don\\'t subscribe to any sort of essentialist naturalism that unreservedly reduces cultural nurture to natural nature, the more-than-biomaterial subject to the physiology of the biological body in and of itself In fact, in Damasio\\'s defense, his multitiered model of the embodied self avoids the trap of the false dichotomy pitting antinaturalism against naturalism as an either-or choice (again, in Leninist-Stalinist ogy, \"both are worse!\"). Sometimes Zizek himself elegantly navigates around this impasse. But, at select moments, he seems to force this false choice in elaborating his critical observations as regards, in particular, the neurosciences, evolutionary theory, and ecology. 182 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

However, as I will make evident in chapter I3 through a close reading of Panksepp\\'s Ajfoctive Neuroscience in conjunction with further parsing of the proposals of Damasio and LeDoux, those aspects of ence most relevant for forging a Freudian-Lacanian neuro-psychoanalysis are far from trafficking in the clumsy, unrefined oversimplifications of reductive strains of evolutionary psychology dogmatically insisting upon the ultimate centrality of \"natural adaptation.\" (The non-Lacanian neuro-psychoanalysis of Solms and his collaborators will also be mentioned later in tandem with cal reflections on the engagements with the neurosciences elaborated by the Lacanian Pommier and the former Lacanian Green.) A specific combination of neuroscience and psychoanalysis requires critically amending and qualifying ZiZek\\'s Lacanian emphasis on the breadth and depth of human beings\\' fyingdenaturalization: this denaturalization, as non-or anti adaptive relative to the presumed standards of deeply entrenched evolutionary rhythms and tines, is quite a bit less than absolute and all-pervasive. The dis-or maladaptation of which Zizek speaks fails to break neatly and cleanly with older traces of \"adaptation\" as patterns of cognition and ment laid down by much more archaic temporal strata of evolutionary history. A dis-or maladaptation as a sharp, absolute rupture with anything \"natural\" is, in a number of ways, far more adaptive than the partial and incomplete ralization that leaves humans stranded, as malformed Frankenstein-like jumbles of mismatched fragments thrown together over the course of unsynchronized sequences of aleatory events, halfway between nature and culture, between the lingering adaptations of evolutionary histories and those demanded by human histories past and present.137 Additionally, when surfacing within the context of contemporary sociocultural circumstances, previously \"adaptive\" behaviors conditioned by ancient evolutionary pressures can be much more maladaptive than the thoughts and actions of subjects steered by the sociocultural tors responsible for human disadaptation. Put differently, in the \"inverted world\" of human reality, dis-or maladaptation can be more adaptive than adaptation itself. Related to this, the conflictuality of overriding interest to psychoanalysis (i.e., those conflicts analytic metapsychology portrays as tense fissures central to the structuration of psychical subjectivity) almost certainly includes flicts between evolutionary nature (associated with adaptation) and tionaryantinature (associated with dis-or maladaptation) as well as conflicts EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł 183 ',\n",

But, whatever the extent of its partial successes, it repeatedly fails fully to tame and ticate savage, resistant undercurrents whose archaic flows, however diluted by \"civilizing\" influences, continue to spill over into the present.

       " \"AFFECTS ARE SIGNIFIERS THE INFINITE JUDGMENT OF A LACANIAN AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE Before turning to the task of elaborating a Freudian-Lacanian approach to the science of the emotional brain, a few general, preliminary remarks are in order. An irony acutely painful to partisans of analysis is that, over the course of the past several decades, Freud repeatedly has been pronounced dead and buried right at the moment when the life sciences are coming to confirm many of his core discoveries and insights, a moment of scientific vindication he anticipates starting with his earliest (proto analytic writings.! The time of Freud's apparent defeat is precisely the time of his actual triumph. A little over a century ago, in the context of century Europe, Freud was forced to argue fiercely against a deeply entrenched, widespread tendency to equate the mental with the conscious, a tendency responsible for some of the resistance to his central, fundamental ur-concept of the unconscious. Today, the assertion that not all of mental life is conscious is uncontroversial: every branch of nonpsychoanalytic psychology and science accepts as an empirically well-established truth the fact that the vast majority of mental life transpires below the threshold of explicit conscious awareness.2 Nobody nowadays bickers about whether significant portions of the cognitive, emotional, and motivational processes of the brain or mind unfold in nonconscious ways. A number of eminent figures in the ences have no problem whatsoever with acknowledging the existence of the psychoanalytic unconscious as a crucial, influential subsector of the broader \",\n",
       " 'category of the nonconscious. Additionally, there is an observation that ought to alleviate a typical Freudian-Lacanian worry aroused whenever anything ing to do with the physical sciences is put forward as potentially relevant to psychoanalysis: contemporary neuroscientific research is far from pointing in the direction of a vulgar mechanistic materialism crudely reducing nurture to nature, the more than biological to pure biology alone. If anything, the rosciences arguably are generating out of themselves a spontaneous cal materialism of a nonreductive sort in which the concepts and distinctions underpinning debates between already recognized varieties of naturalism and antinaturalism are being subverted and sublated in various fashions yet to be adequatelyappteciated.3 Reassuming a more precise angle of focus, Panksepp\\'s Affective ence, a comprehensive overview of research into the emotional dimensions of both human and animal brains, provides a number of points of departure for the endeavor to entwine together the neurosciences, Freudian-Lacanian choanalysis, and the specific metapsychological perspectives on affective life outlined previously here. The fact that Panksepp refuses to limit his discussion of the emotional brain to human brains alone is based on his conviction that likely would ruffle more than a few Lacanian feathers: He insists that human and nonhuman mammals in particular share a great deal in common in terms of basic brain structures and functions, including emotional configurations and dynamics at various neural levels (especially at the most primitive levels of evolutionarily conserved neuroanatomy).4 Panksepp hypothesizes that tion has wired into the archaic base of the mammalian central nervous system a fixed set of seven rudimentary, elementary emotions and corresponding riential tonalities. His taxonomy of the \"major \\'Blue-Ribbon, Grade A: tional systems of the mammalian brain\"s identifies four such systems, which are labeled \"SEEKING\" (stimulus-bound appetitive behavior and tion), \"PANIC\" (stimulus-bound distress vocalization and social attachment), \"RAGE\" (stimulus-bound biting and affective attack), and \"FEAR\" bound flight and escape behaviors).6 Plus, there are, in mammals particularly, three additional systems, .which are labeled \"LUST,\" \"CARE; and These seven emotions and their accompanying tones of feeling are depicted as the primary colors of mammals\\' multihued affective lives.8 (Solms and his coauthor Oliver Turnbull, in their sizable manifesto for a non-Lacanian psychoanalysis The Brain and the Inner World, adopt Panksepp\\'s hypothesis concerning \"basic emotions\").9 Panksepp maintains that human beings are just as moved as nonhuman mammals by this set of foundational emotional 186 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'elements. In this vein, Damasio, a similar emotional of affective phenomena, observes that the brain sculpted evolution certainly looks as though it\\'s much more prone to pain over pleasure: \"1here seem to be far more varieties of negative than positive emotions:\\'10 It would not be inappropriate to call to mind, in association with this, the factual detail that the early Freud, in The Interpretation o/Dreams, originally christened the fundamental law of psychical life the \"un pleasure principle\" (later to be ignated with the more familiar phrase \"pleasure principle\") so as to size the avoidance of pain and suffering as the primary tendency of the psyche (instead of emphasizing the \"positive\" side of this principle, that is, the dency to pursue ecstasy, gratification, joy, satisfaction, and so on)Y LeDoux, in his treatment of affective neuroscience, similarly proposes that \"brain evolution is basically conservative.\"12 LeDoux, like Panksepp, sees human affective life as resting on a base, shared with other mammals, of primitive tional reactions and repertoires installed by ancient, long-gone evolutionary contexts and challenges. It should be noted once more that the \"conservative\" lingering-on of out-of-date neural machinery and programs is precisely part of what produces some of the tensions characteristic \\nof the peculiarities ing the unique \"human condition\" of such concern to psychoanalysis. As was stated in the earlier critical assessment ofZizek\\'s reading of Damasio (in chapter 12), it would be mistaken to respond to the neuroscientific account of the tence of evolutionarily archaic emotional systems hardwired into humans\\' brains with an antinaturalism, Lacanian or otherwise, which goes so far as to deny (at this juncture, quite untenably, not only theoretically but also empirically) that speaking subjects, thanks to the \"castrating\" intervention of symbolic orders, retain any significant links with their material or physical bodies as analyzed specifically by the natural sciences. (This response, often voiced by Lacanians and like-minded theorists, posits an always-already complete denaturalization as essential to the existence of subjectivity proper.) As partial rather than complete, the denaturalization that befalls those submitted to sociosymbolic tion splits human subjects between, as it were, nature and antinature, failing fully to liquidate the former retroactively and without remainder; the antagonisms and discrepancies between natural and antinatural residues embedded as strata and currents uneasily cohabitating within the psychical apparatus contribute to the splitting (Spaltung) central to the barred subject ($).

In light of my nascent version of neuro-psychoanalysis, LeDoux\\'s work on the brain is appealing for several reasons. Apart from generally being thetic to psychoanalysis insofar as he both admits the existence of the analytic unconscious and highlights the significant role oflanguage in the neuromental lives of human subjects, LeDoux claims again and again that, apropos tive phenomena, conscious awareness is the exception rather than the ruleY (Panksepp concurs,14 likewise asserting, \"Most of emotional processing, as of every other psychobehavioral process, is done at an unconscious level.\")15 And, in line with an established consensus in the neurosciences, LeDoux is adamant that a dialectic between genetic nature and epigenetic or nongenetic (with \"nongenetic\" encompassing behavioral and symbolic factors) nurture shapes emotional and other brain functions such that neither a simplistic biologism nor an equally unsophisticated social constructivism can offer remotely sible explanations for affects (and many other things) in human beings.16 (Eva Jablonka and Marion J. Lamb\\'s four-dimensional analysis of evolution, taking into consideration genetic, epigenetic, behavioral, and symbolic dimensions, provides perhaps the best evolutionary-theoretic complement to this scientific research and its resultsP These two authors contend that \"it is bad biology to think about the nervous system in isolation\"18 and that \"the aries between the social sciences and biology are being broken down. People are aware that neither social nor biological evolution can be studied in lation.\")19 The potentials of LeDoux\\'s neuroscientific delineations of human emotional life for a Freudian-Lacanian neuro-psychoanalytic metapsychology of affect are manifest in the closing pages of his book The Emotional Brain: \"Consciousness is neither the prerequisite to nor the same thing as the capacity to think and reason. An animal can solve lots of problems without being overtly conscious of what it is doing and why it is doing it. Obviously, consciousness elevates thinking to a new level, but it isn\\'t the same thing as thinking.\"20 After these statements echoing Freud\\'s century-old gesture of decoupling thinking from consciousness-the psychoanalytic unconscious involves forms of ing minus an accompanying reflexive self-awareness (i.e., \"1 think without thinking that 1 think\")-LeDoux proceeds to discuss affective phenomena: Emotional feelings result when we become consciously aware that an tion system of the brain is active.

The difFerence between fear, anxiety, terror, apprehension, and the like would not be possible without language. At the same time, none of these words would have any point if it were not for the existence of an underlying emotion system that generates the brain states and bodily expressions to which these words apply. Emotions evolved not as conscious feelings, linguistically differentiated or otherwise, but as brain states and bodily responses. The brain states and bodily responses are the fundamental facts of an emotion, and the conscious feelings are the frills that have added icing to the emotional cake.21 According to LeDoux\\'s dialectical model, the initial impetus and oomph lying affective life originates with and arises from evolutionarily primal and primary corporeal emotions of a fundamental and foundational nature (i.e., the emotions identified by Panksepp in his seven-category taxonomy). ever, in the exceptional animals that are human beings as parletres, the getic, vital flows of these old mammalian juices run smack into language, being channeled through the mediating networks of the linguistic-representational structures constitutive of speaking subjectivities. Such structures then come to exert a reciprocal counterinfluence on these archaic influences, refracting, for instance, the effects of the FEAR and PANIC systems into a much more fine-grained spectrum offeelings (i.e., \"fear, anxiety, terror, apprehension, and the like\": Damasio, in Descartes\\' Error, similarly distinguishes between mary emotions\" and \"secondary emotions\").22 But, a pressing question must be posed at this juncture: do these thus refracted feelings react back on their emotional bases, dialectically transforming their corporeal causes or sources, and, if so, to what extent? Despite elsewhere indicating that he indeed would at least admit and tain the possibility of linguistic-representational nurture reflexively altering embodied emotional nature in a thoroughly dialectical fashion, LeDoux, at the very end of the last block quotation in the previous paragraph, seems to risk regressing back to a nondialectical position according to which alterations to affective life wrought by the nonnatural or not-entirely-natural sions determinative of humanity\\'s distinguishing peculiarities are reduced to an ineffectual secondary status as mere window dressing arrayed around the fringes of a fixed, unchanged biomaterial ground (\"the conscious feelings are the frills that have added icing to the emotional cake\").

Second, this same moment in the concluding pages of The tional Brain overlooks something The Parallax View rightly and insightfully highlights, namely, that the gap between the biological and the biological comes to function as itself an affective factor, rather than affective phenomena falling exclusively on one side or the other of this gap (i.e., as either emotions of a biological nature or feelings of a more-than-biological nurture). Maybe what makes an affect a specifically human experience (as distinct from the bodily emotions and psychological feelings evidently also undergone by nonhuman sentient mammals) is its bearing witness to humanity\\'s status as stranded in an ontological limbo between nature and anti nature, torn between split planes of existence irrupting out of the immanence of a self-sundering material Real. 24 Returning to more empirical terrain and examining Panksepp\\'s work in greater depth promises to be fruitful. Several times, he stresses that tieity holds for emotional systems as much as for other components of human neuroanatomy.25 In relation to this, he (like both Damasio and LeDoux) grants that cognitive mediations and modulations, involving complex symbolic and linguistic representational constellations, play significant roles in coloring and inflecting affective phenomena in human life;26 a two-way street of dialectical and reciprocal co-determination connects cognition and emotion for beings with highly developed cerebral cortices in addition to other, \"lower\" neural components left over from archaic evolutionary histories and shared with various other animal organisms.27 Panksepp goes so far as to argue, as regards humans, that \"one can never capture innate emotional dynamics in their pure form, except perhaps when they are aroused artificially by direct stimulation of brain areas where those operating systems are most concentrated.\"28 ing this argument later, he states: It is becoming increasingly clear that humans have as many instinctual ing systems in their brains as other mammals. However, in mature humans such instinctual processes may be difficult to observe because they are no ger expressed directly in adult behavior but instead are filtered and modified 190 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'by higher cognitive activity. Thus, in adult humans, many instincts manifest \\nthemselves only as subtle psychological tendencies, such as subjective feeling states, which provide internal guidance to behavior. The reason many scholars who know little about modern brain research are still willing to assert that human behavior is not controlled by instinctual processes is because many of our operating systems are in fact very \"open\" and hence very prone to be modified by the vast layers of cognitive and affective complexity that learning permits. Still, the failure of psychology to deal effectively with the nature of the many instinctual systems of human and animal brains remains one of the great failings of the discipline. The converse could be said for neuroscience.29 A number of comments are called for \\nhere. To begin with, in the second half of this quotation, Panksepp accurately and succinctly diagnoses the parallel comings of \"psychology\" (as associated with nurture-centric constructivism) and \"neuroscience\" (as associated with nature-centric biologism) with respect to the (partially obsolete) debate between naturalism and antinaturalism. In Panksepp\\'s view, the plasticity of the human central nervous system, a plasticity affecting its emotional structures and dynamics, consists of the intertwining of inflexible \"closed\" and flexible \"open\" neural systems (i.e., on the one hand, those systems rigidly wired by genetics to produce relatively invariant patterns of cognition and comportment, and, on the other hand, those systems fluidly wired to be rewired by epigenetic or nongenetic accidents, contingencies, ables, and so on).30 In response to Panksepp, someone with Hegelian or psychoanalytic leanings might be inclined to retort that the purportedly epistemological ity of brute, raw instinctual emotions is not strictly and solely epistemological. Shouldn\\'t Panksepp\\'s spontaneous Kantianism, in which \"pure\" instinctual emotions are treated as thinkable-yet-unknowable noumenal selves that exist beyond the epistemologically accessible affective phenomena \"filtered and modified by higher cognitive activity:\\' be met with a ism speculating that this ostensible epistemological inaccessibility already directly discloses the \"Thing itself.\" the ontological Real supposedly barred by subjective reflection? In other words, certain versions of Hegelian phy and Freudian-Lacanian psychoanalytic metapsychology would insist that the general absence of brute, raw instinctual emotions in the manifestations of specifically human existence is a testament to the thoroughgoing cal digestion of the natural by the more-than-natural, rather than a reflection of a noumenal-phenomenal split between these two dimensions depicted as AFFECTS ARE SIGNIFIERS Ł 191 ',\n",

Pommier, whose Lacanian glosses on the ences I will address in more detail later, appears to adopt a stance along these lines, maintaining that \"once the entry into speech has been accomplished, \\'pure sensation\\' becomes that from which we exile ourselves.\"3l He adds that conceding this necessitates abandoning the \"myth of an original paradise, that of our improbable animality.\"32 Of course, to be perfectly honest and exact, portraying Panksepp as a taneous Kantian treating basic emotions (i.e., his seven \"primary colors\" of mammalian affective life) as akin to the notorious Ding an sich is far from fair. His denial of epistemological access to these emotional fundaments is not without qualification (in contrast with Kant\\'s unqualified denial of access to the noumenal realm lying forever beyond \"the limits of possible experience\"). Panksepp posits that there are exceptional circumstances in which these primal constituents of human bodily being come to light in their undiluted diacy. However, he stresses the artificiality of these circumstances; in addition to the experimental tools and techniques of the laboratory that he has in mind, one might also imagine, taking into account psychoanalytic and sociopolitical considerations, brutal ordeals and overwhelming traumas as excessive \"limit experiences\" violently unleashing unprocessed corporeal intensities pitilessly reducing those who suffer these experiences to the dehumanized state of naked animality, of convulsing, writhing flesh. This precise qualification noted by Panksepp signals an inversion that itself arguably is constitutive of the human condition: the reversal of the respective positions or roles of, so to speak, first and second natures (or Zizek\\'s life 1.0 and life 2.0), a reversal in which the ondary becomes the primary and vice versa. Such an inversion can be clarified further through reference to Giorgio Agamben\\'s Homo Sacer. Therein, Agamben examines the distinction, rooted in the language of ancient Greece, between \"zoe, which expressed the simple fact of living common to aU living beings (animals, men, or gods), and bios, which indicated the form or way of living proper to an individual or a group.\"33 Without getting bogged down in what would be, in the present context, a gential exegesis of Agamben\\'s genealogy of the distinction between zoe and bios in relation to structures of political sovereignty (a genealogy inspired by both Nietzsche and Foucault and particularly indebted to the latter\\'s concept of\"biopower\"),34 it suffices for now to draw attention to his contention that, in the always-already established individual and group forms or ways of life into 192 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

On the contrary, the very possibility of distinguishing life and law, anomie and nomos, coincides with their tion in the biopolitical machine. Bare life is a product of the machine and not something that preexists it.\"36 In other words, in tandem with his rejection of standard, traditional \"state of nature\" narratives about humanity\\'s transition from pre-sociohistorical zoe red in tooth and nail to the sociohistorical bios of the polis as established on the basis of a \"social contrace\\'37 Agamben proposes that humans are, at a default level, beings of bios (i.e., life organized and lished by more-than-biologicallanguages, institutions, practices, and so on) rather than creatures of zoe. Put differently, although the bare life that is zoe often is imagined as a first nature ontogenetically and phylogenetically ing bios as the second nature of a nonbare life clothed by the artificial tions of language, society, and history, Agamben\\'s remarks correctly point out that exceptional \"artificial\" means (for him, the means being actions taken by established sovereign power with respect to the subject-bodies it rules over) are necessary to strip away the default second-nature-become-first-nature that is bios. In the inverted world of human life, zoe is correspondingly a become-secondary, an exception to the rule of bios that appears, in nian parlance, exclusively in legal-political \"states of exception\" enacted in the names of unusual circumstances and alleged crises.38 To circumnavigate back to Panksepp and neuroscientific matters, a bination of Agamben\\'s handling of the zoe-bios distinction with my position which is neither naturalist nor antinaturalist, a position centered on a esized failed dialectic of incomplete denaturalization that is constitutive of human forms of subjectivity, enables the following to be said apropos a influenced neuro-psychoanalytic metapsychology of affect: In human beings, the zoe of bare emotional life-this life doesn\\'t disappear with the advent of the bios of feelings and the array of their accompanying conditions of bility, but is only partially eclipsed and absorbed by the mediating matrices giving shape to bios-is fractured, like Damasio\\'s core self, into unsublated brute, raw basic emotions (which manifest themselves solely in rare, extreme conditions) and sublated feelings as sociosymbolically translated emotions (or even, following Zizek, as affective states aroused by the gap between tions and feelings).

For Panksepp, the differences between cognition and emotion are at least as important to keep in view as the fact of their reciprocal, entwined relatedness insofar as these differences are the sites of palpable tion between conflicting components and tendencies of subjects\\' incompletely integrated, hodgepodge brains. He claims that, although the affective lives of human beings are substantially inflected by cognitive (i.e., cultural, ideational, linguistic, representational, social, symbolic, and so on) mediations, the pelling, gripping, potent pulsations of emotional phenomena issue forth from a comparatively ancient, primitive neural base.40 Furthermore, he maintains that an imbalance obtains between cognition and emotion as unequal partners in mental life: \"emotions and regulatory feelings have stronger effects on nitions than the other way around.\"41 In terms of the calibration constitutive of (neuro) plasticity between open flexibility and closed inflexibility, Panksepp stresses that a certain degree of genetic closure at the level of basic emotional systems (deposited in brains over the course of the old, slow-moving currents of evolutionary times) sets limiting boundaries for the bandwidths of possible epigenetic or nongenetic openness to denaturalizing alterations of affective spectrums (alterations unfolding at temporal rhythms and rates of tively much faster speeds than natural-qua-evolutionary times): \"the ability of the human cortex to think and to fantasize, and thereby to pursue many unique paths of human cultural evolution, can dilute, mold, modify, and focus the tates of these systems, but it cannot eliminate them.\"42 (Damasio argues for a similar perspective.)43 To segue into a space of overlap between the neurosciences and Lacanian metapsychology, not only is the human brain a concrete, biomaterial point of condensation for the only partially compatible temporal tracks of man evolutionary phylogeny and human sociohistorical phylogeny, but, as 194 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

As indicated in a much earlier sion (in chapter II), Lacan\\'s distinction between lalangue and la langue is quite relevant in the context of the current analysis. Pommier says something odd that sounds less strange once one appreciates select details of Lac an\\'s rich, tifaceted treatments oflanguage: \"neuroscientists forget ... speech, ... the port of which, far from being spiritual, is also material.\"44The oddness has to do with the fact that ample neuroscientific attention has been paid to \\nlanguage, at least in the Lacanian sense of la langue, which refers to the natural languages usually acquired by children and employed by linguistically competent bers of given groups of language users. Pommier\\'s insistence on the material dimension of \"speech\" (fa parole) is crucial here: when it comes to both the spoken and the written, Freudian-Lacanian psychoanalytic metapsychology is at least as concerned with materiality as with meaning. The primary cess mentation of lalangue, as a jouis-sens playing with phonemes and emes, flows through sounds and images in ways unconstrained by secondary process mentation\\'s concerns to obey the constraining rules of a language\\'s (as une langue) syntax and semantics so as to succeed at producing tively recognizable conventional significance. An analyst, in listening to an analysand\\'s speech, should be as attentive to the murmurings of meaningless lalangue as to the meaningful utterances of la langue spoken by the (self-) conscious speaker on the couch. When Lacan draws attention to the material signifier (as being different from the sign), this is part of what\\'s at stake at those moments.45 This is one of the two fundamental aspects oflanguage that mier sees the neurosciences overlooking (the other being the links between language and Otherness as understood in Lacanian theory, a topic to be taken up soon below). As regards lalangue as distinct from la langue, Changeux, who Pommier cites in beginning to weave a neuro-psychoanalytic perspective on language,46 indeed does touch upon infantile babbling in a neurological account of guage acquisition.47 One of Changeux\\'s key theses is his assertion that \"to learn is to eliminate.\"48 He hypothesizes that the developing brain learns numerous things of various sorts through playing \"cognitive games.\" These games involve the brain spontaneously generating \"pre-representations:\\' an activity that could be described as a process of actively fantasizing, imagining, or hallucinating at the surrounding world, creatively concocting \"hypotheses\" projected onto AFFECTS ARE SIGNIFIERS Ł 195 ',\n",

Through interactions with the environment, especially the social milieus oflanguage-using adult others, the infant is prompted to pare down the proliferating plethora of noises of its baby tongue (i.e., lalangue) so as to give voice to the narrower set of well-ordered phonemes recognized by the mother tongue (i.e., la langue) into which hel she is being inducted. (This is analogous to Kant\\'s account, in his Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View, of how the externally dictated discipline of education and tion transforms the excessive, unruly freedom of the human child as pre-or protorational into the tamed and domesticated autonomy of the adult nal subject.)5l In other words, early childhood language acquisition isn\\'t so much a matter of building up une langue; it\\'s more a matter of tearing down and eliminating (or, more accurately, attempting to eliminate) the nonsensical meanderings and ramblings of lalangue, of the cognitive games jouis-sens plays with the vocal apparatus. La langue is part of what remains of lalangue after the contextually imposed trimming and snipping of \"symbolic castration\" by the transsubjective Other and intersubjective others of the linguistic universes into which the child is inserted has been undergone. However, psychoanalysis especially divulges veritable mountains of evidence that, sheltering within the parletre of la langue, vestiges of lalangue continue to manifest themselves, ticularly in the forms familiar from the Freudian \"psychopathology of everyday life:\\' namely, dreams, jokes, parapraxes, slips of the tongue, and so on; the roscientific study oflanguage would do well to consider more thoroughly such evidence and phenomena. Apropos neurology, Changeux\\'s theory of learning reflects what LeDoux characterizes as the \"use it or lose it\" doctrine of neural \"selection ism:\\' ing to this doctrine, the initial \"exuberance\" of an infant\\'s neural there are more synaptic connections present in early stages of development than will be needed later by the more mature organism-is pruned down through \"subtraction:\\' through the exchanges between organism and ment determining which connections will be used (and, hence, will be kept) and which ones won\\'t be used (and, hence, will be allowed to atrophy or pletely wither away).52 Changeux describes this selectionist process as \"the epigenetic stabilization of common neural networks\"53 (i.e., a social dynamic 196 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'mirror neurons in which the structures of the young child\\'s brain are sculpted through pruning to be more or less sufficiently similar, for purposes of linguistic acculturation, to his/her older fluent symbolic others).54 Pommier recapitulates everything summarized in the preceding graphs.55The Lacanian supplement he adds to the neuroscientific theories is an emphasis on the irreducible role ofintersubjective and transsubjective variables (i.e., Imaginary others and Symbolic Others) in the genesis of sociosymbolic subjectivity in the immature subject-to-be. Pommier adamantly maintains that spontaneous endogenous developments within the physiological systems of the nascent parletre don\\'t account for language acquisition and the cation it brings with it. That is to say, the eliminations and selections imposed on the child\\'s neural networks-these eliminations and selections are pruning processes through which the wild thickets of lalangue\\'s jouis-sens-laden blings (i.e., primary processes) are cut down (albeit, for psychoanalysis, not purged altogether without remainder) into the narrower confines of ably meaningful forms of une langue (i.e., secondary processes)-are imposed thanks to the interactive interventions of Significant (and signifying) others actively engaging with the child. For Pommier, \"the signification of sounds depends on a sense given by an exterior authority: it breaks with the organicist model of auto-organization. This rupture with organizational self-sufficiency distinguishes itself from the muscular model. Organicism cannot render an account of neuronal modeling, since the only efficacious sonorities are those that signify something for the Other.\"56 He quickly proceeds to link this with a more general theme emerging from the life sciences and philosophical pretations of them: the plastic human brain in particular is genetically destined to be turned over to shaping vicissitudes far from entirely governed by lutionary-genetic influences alone, and is naturally preprogrammed by ics to be nonnaturally reprogrammed by epigenetics or nongenetics; in short, hardwired to be rewired.57 As Pommier puts it regarding the Lacanian Other as the locus of epigenetic or nongenetic factors of a symbolico-linguistic sort, \"It is henceforth innate that it wouldn\\'t be innate\";58 or, as his fellow Lacanian neurosympathizers Ansermet and Magistretti articulate the same idea, it is \"as though, when all is said and done, the individual were to appear genetically determined not to be genetically determined.\"59 To make one last fast-and-loose reference to Zizek\\'s contrast between life 1.0 and life 2.0, an argument parallel to the one I laid out in chapter 12 apropos the layering oflife La and life 2.0 that is neither natural \\nnor anti natural (i.e., the AFFECTS ARE SIGNIFIERS Ł 197 ',\n",

Of course, such a claim is merely in good keeping with Freudian doxy insofar as psychoanalysis, despite certain widespread misunderstandings, isn\\'t a developmental psychology, at least not in any straightforward sense. More precisely, due to what Freud characterizes as the \"timelessness\" of the unconscious,60 prior phases of ontogenetic development (i.e., past periods of psychical experience and structure) are not expunged and replaced by quent phases of development. Instead, the effects of the passage of time on the psyche involve the cumulative sedimentation of interacting layers, rather than successive demolitions of the old by the new (this point being illustrated by Freud with that image of the city of Rome in which all of the strata of its torical development are preserved side by side, sandwiched together).61 But, what relevance does this have for a Freudian-Lacanian neuro-psychoanalysis of affective life? The sociosymbolically subjectified parletre comes to consist tently) of, so to speak, a sort of Tower of Babel cobbled together out of a jumble mixing together flows and assemblages of both \"immature\" lalangue (which, as suffused with jouis-sens, is neither strictly affective-energetic nor structural) and \"mature\" la langue. Additionally, the affect-languages of the latter (i.e., the words and phrases of natural languages designating emotions and feelings) are notoriously ambiguous and vague. In fact, one of the most familiar ways in which people arrive at a palpable awareness of the limits guage is when they wrestle with the clumsy, clunky inadequacy of their mother tongue in trying to express linguistically the subtle nuances and fine-grained shades of fluid affective phenomena. The combination of affectively tial (yet consciously difficult-to-recognize) associations at the level of lalangue with the superimposed level of the inelegant affect-languages ofla langue makes for a confusing and dizzyingly disorienting intrapsychical and subjective cacophony of tongues, a multivoiced soliloquy that sometimes loudly clamors and sometimes softly murmurs. Consequently, knowing how, what, and why one feels what one feels can be nearly impossible in certain instances.

From his perspective, the key problem here is one of constructing an accurate taxonomy of affects: how should primary and secondary emotions, various feeling states, and related phenomena be classified, and with what linguistic labels ?62 Panksepp directly evinces the concern that the affect-vocabularies of natural languages are too equivocal and imprecise to furnish affective neuroscience with concept-terms of sufficient clarity and distinctness to carve with rigorous representational cision the realities of the emotional brain at, as it were, its real joints. This is the exact juncture at which a proper Hegelian gesture with respect to Panksepp's neuroscience of affects is both possible and productive, a gesture mobilizing the interrelated life-scientific facts and notions of neuroplasticity and genetics.63 (It's no accident that Malabou's philosophically fruitful turn to the neurosciences was initially motivated by her sophisticated appreciation of the role of plasticity in Hegel's anthropology.)64The Hegel-style move to be made in this context is to assert that the difficulty of naming affective phenomena is not external to the thing itself. Worded differently, the ambiguities, vagueness, equivocations, and imprecision of the intermingled affect-languages of both lalangue and les langues don't remain neatly confined to a separate tational outside (say, scientific discourses supposedly apart from their objects of investigation) without effects on neurologically grounded emotional being. Or, put in yet other terms, the uncertainties Panksepp highlights that raise doubts about any taxonomy in affective neuroscience aren't just indicative of purely epistemological-representational inadequacies internal to scientific courses; these uncertainties reflect the uncertainties of affective life in and of itself, a life in which felt feelings circulate among a much vaster range of unfelt and misfelt feelings. This Hegelian gesture vis-a.-vis Panksepp is justified for a number of reasons, many of which I have formulated already. To begin with, neuroplasticity is now a well-established, undisputed matter of scientific fact. Part of what the side of plasticity involving flexibility and malleability entails is the brain's cally dictated openness to epigenetic or nongenetic dictates.6s In Lacanian eyes, symbolic orders constitute one of the most significant sources (if not the most significant source) of more-than-genetic factors influential in the vicissitudes of ontogenetic subject formation. The physiologically and psychologically momentous period of language acquisition is a time during which (in nese) lalangue is affected by la langue (an affecting for which neuroplasticity is one of the crucial material conditions of its very possibility that is contingent AFFECTS ARE SIGNIFIERS Ł 199 \",\n",

Obviously, one sizable tor of the language or languages thus identified with consists of vocabularies for affective phenomena. Once created on these bases and in these ways, the parletre, the speaking subject who speaks to him-/herself and others about, among other things, affective phenomena using arguably hazy and inexact affect-vocabularies, is autoaffecting, an autoaffection that both (re)acts on the neural foundations participating in its generation and is routed through the heteroaffective mediation of others and Others. Furthermore, it\\'s worth remembering at this point that the contemporary sciences of the brain emphasize the co-penetrating entanglements of the nitive and emotional systems of the massively interconnected human central nervous system (or, translated into Lacan\\'s terminology, signifiers and affects aren\\'t, in actuality if not in theory, cleanly partitioned and independent in tion to each other). This means that the cognitive dimension of affect-language gets woven into the emotional dimension of affects themselves, setting in motion an oscillating, back-and-forth dialectic of mutual, two-way modulation between affects and signifiers. (LeDoux draws attention to this in less cal terms.)67 Consequently, the reflexive autoaffective dynamics of the parletre qua $, dynamics in which the confusing muddiness of the emotional lexicons of overlapping lalangue and la langue swirls about, result in fuzzy and cise affect-vocabularies literally bedding down in the brain itsel£ sculpting and rewiring this groundless neural ground. Hence, Panksepp\\'s lack of Hegelian sensibilities when considering the linguistic naming and representation of emotions and feelings is an instructive example of what Pommier might mean when he accuses neuroscientists of \"forgetting\" the issue oflanguage larly language as understood in Lacanian psychoanalytic theory).68 This also lends illustrative support to Pommier\\'s contention that \"more and more of the numerous results of the neurosciences are illegible without psychoanalysis.\"69 A similar absence of Hegelian finesse afRicts the non-Lacanian choanalysis advocated by Solms.

These dangers and difficulties aside, Solms and Turnbull helpfully highlight a number of interesting sites of overlap between psychoanalysis and the sciences. In particular, they emphasize, in a resonation with earlier discussions, the various important roles of neurologically hardwired \"blanks\" in the human brain, namely, hardwired absences of hard wiring. Such preprogrammed ings, openings for reprogramming, are, in their view, crucial conditions for the potential eventual genesis of the forms of subjectivity familiar to quotidian experience generally and psychoanalytic clinical practice specifically. priating Panksepp\\'s taxonomy of the evolutionarily primary basic emotion systems shared between humans and other mammals, Solms and Turnbull associate the SEEKING system with the Freudian notion of the id-Ievel seat of the drives, that is, the motivational foundations of the libidinal economy. In so doing, they claim that Freud\\'s crucial thesis regarding the \"objectless\" status of the drives72 is vindicated by the neuroscientific discovery that the SEEKING system acquires its orienting coordinates (i.e., what exactly, in terms of objects and states of affairs, is craved, desired, wanted, and so on) exclusively over time through experience, learning, and so on.73 Apart from the SEEKING system, Solms and Turnbull, when addressing as a whole Panksepp\\'s overall taxonomic schema for the evolutionary foundations of the emotional brain, are anxious to underscore that adopting this schema isn\\'t tantamount to capitulating to a reductive naturalism or mechanistic rialism eliminating much of what a psychoanalytic approach would wish to conserve.

In what seems to be a strangely neglected book, La causalite psychique: Entre nature et culture (1995), the ex-Lacanian Andre Green directly confronts some of the challenging, vexing issues haunting any effort to bring together choanalysis and the neurosciences. (Borrowing David Chalmers\\'s phrase,78 one could credit Green with tackling head-on the neuro-psychoanalytic version of the \"hard problem\" around which mind-body debates in Anglo-American lytic philosophy orbit.) Green touches on a number of claims and topics dealt with earlier here: the significant influence oflanguage as a higher-order tive function on the embodied psyche;79 the contextual mediation of the brain as dependent for its structures and dynamics on its particular physical and tural-symbolic environs;80 the inseparable entanglement of nature and nurture in human subjects, to the point of the difference often being indiscernible for all intents and purposes;81 the biologically inborn incompleteness of human beings as naturally destining humans to sociosexual denaturalization;82 the drive-level intersections at which soma and psyche are soldered to each other while nonetheless remaining relatively distinct from one another.83 For anyone acquainted with Lacan\\'s writings, the title of Green\\'s book is likely to call to mind the eerit \"Presentation on Psychical Causality\" (1946). Therein, Lacan speaks of \"the intersection of the biological and the social:\\'84 He proceeds to remark that \"man is far more than his body, even though he can know [sa voir ] nothing more about his being.\"85 Lest this remark be mistaken for marking an abrupt break with anything biological, Lacan, consonant with ous lines of his thought expressed elsewhere,86 hints a page later at the relevance 202 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

And yet, Green\\'s analytic \"materialism\" refuses to ground the psyche in the brain.95 Instead, with a nod to certain religious notions, he \"pleads for a \\'laicized\\' soul that we designate as such in order to oppose it to cerebral machinery, which is nothing but a pale caricature of that which is the psyche.\"96 He immediately warns one not to \"confound this psyche with the religious soul of a divine essence.\"97 And yet, he subsequently resumes flirting with religiosity, laying out a vision of psychoanalysis as raising the truth of religious antireductionism (as opposed to the purportedly reductive mechanistic materialism of the sciences, including the neurosciences) to the dignity of its secular, \\ndemystified Notion.98 However, in contrast with Green\\'s compromise position between religion and science, what if, reenacting the uncompromising Leninist stance of rialism and Empirio-Criticism (1908), one objects that this psyche qua ized soul really isn\\'t all that secular except for a scientific explanation of how AFFECTS ARE SIGNIFIERS Ł 203 ',\n",

Rather, this is to insist that any materialism worthy of the title must perform, in order to be truly materialist yet simultaneously nonreductive, a sort of theoretical jujitsu trick, namely, a vaguely Godelian-style in-or de completion of the ral sciences. A materialism entirely divorced from the natural sciences (i.e., a staunchly antinaturalist materialism) is materialist in name only; a ist (as opposed to idealist) antinaturalism requires a natural-scientific account of the material possibility conditions for the emergence of the antinatural (as more than natural or material).lOo Playing off an irreducible nonnatural subject, portrayed as a mystery utterly inexplicable in scientific terms, against the tional straw man caricature of a natural neuronal machine governed exclusively by the blind mechanisms of the efficient causalities of evolution and genetics merely reinstates a version of those dualisms that rightly are so anathema to the tradition of authentic (dialectical) materialism.101 When it comes to the subjects of concern to psychoanalysis (i.e., human beings as speaking subjects), the real challenge is to pinpoint and link up two parallel, complementary nodes of explanatory incompleteness within tific and psychoanalytic discourses. A properly formulated ysis does precisely this. It engages in the double move of (I) complementing Freudian-Lacanian psychoanalysis with a naturalist or biological account of the material underpinnings of denaturalized or more-than-biological jectivityand (2) complementing the neurosciences with a sophisticated, tematic metapsychological theory of subjects whose geneses, although tied to brains, involve much more than bare organic anatomy.

One can and should strive to develop a scientifically shaped (although not purely and strictly scientific) account of how humans defying and escaping explanatory encapsulation by the sciences become what they are.102 Correlatively, a materialist psychoanalysis must be, as Lacan would put it, not without its scientific reasons, while maintaining itself as a specific discipline whose objects of inquiry cannot be absorbed unreservedly into jectless material being(s).103 I believe that psychoanalysis nowadays can make 204 Ł \\nMISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

As regards Green specifically, of even greater interest in connection with outlining a neuro-psychoanalytic metapsychology of affect is an early essay by him, \"The Logic of Lacan\\'s objet (a) and Freudian Theory: Convergences and written under the influence of Lac an and published in 1966 in the third issue of the journal Cahiers pour f Analyse. Therein, in a tion of his essay on \"The Problem of the Distinction Between the tative of Drive and the Affect,\" he addresses the relations between, on the one hand, Freud\\'s Vorstellung and Lacan\\'s signifier and, on the other hand, affective phenomena as distinct from such ideational representations and their logics or structures. Speaking of the later Freud, Green enigmatically proposes that \"the affict takes on the status of signifier.\" 104 (He reiterates this a few years later in Le discours vivant.)lOS To Lacanian ears, this sounds odd, to the point of perhaps sounding paradoxical or self-contradictory insofar as Lacan tirelessly insists on the difference in kind separating affects and nifiers. A few paragraphs later, Green seems to reinstate Lacan\\'s distinction between signifier and affect by claiming that the latter, unlike the former, is noncombinatory: \"The specificity of affict is that it cannot enter into tion.\"106 Unlike Lacan, the early Green, in line with Freud, allows for the sibility of affects succumbing to repression.107 But, in Green\\'s view, whereas repressed signifiers qua Vorstellungen come to light only through indirect, winding webs of associative combinations involving multiple ideational resentations of the same type, repressed affects \"can be expressed that is, without passing through the connecting links of the preconscious\"108 (i.e., the matrix of word-presentations [Wortvorstellungen], as per Freud\\'s schema according to which unconscious thing-presentations gen], in order to gain the potential of possibly entering into consciousness, must be matched up with word-presentations in the preconscious).109 One of the guiding assumptions apparently steering Green\\'s proposals in 1966 (an assumption he appears to abandon by 1973) is the notion that affective phenomena, in contrast with linguistic-symbolic signifiers as structured ational representations, enjoy a nonrelational self-sufficiency, an immediate identity-to-self as sameness, in contrast with the mediated non-self-identity of signifiers as (to quote Saussure ) \"differences without positive terms.\" 110 AFFECTS ARE SIGNIl\\'IERS Ł 205 ',\n",

Interestingly, both Lacanian sis and affective neuroscience seem to concur that this equation is problematic, if not nonsensically impossible. Empirical studies of the brain have uncovered evidence supporting the Freudian-Lacanian thesis regarding the distinction between emotional affects and cognitive representations.l!l However, one should bear in mind that the neurosciences also often simultaneously maintain that, in most real-time brain dynamics, emotions and cognitions, although tinguishable through neuroanatomical analysis, are de facto indistinguishable through neurodynamic synthesis insofar as they are inextricably intertwined in lived reality. Apropos Lacan, one of the best ways to secure a grip on the nature of and justifications for his fashion of differentiating between signifiers and affects is to return to the topic of deception. For Lacan, both signifiers and affects are deceptive. But, they each deceive, according to him, in ways that are fundamentally different in kind. Going through Lacan\\'s corpus and cataloguing the numerous forms of deception engendered by signifiers detailed therein would be a daunting, protracted task (one not to be undertaken here). Zizek, for instance, often draws tion to the title of Lacan\\'s twenty-first seminar of 1973-1974: Les non-dupes errant (\"the non-dupes err:\\' roughly homophonous with ie Nom-du-Pere [the Name-of-the-FatherJ). Succinctly summarized, the Name-of-the-Father, as a master signifier (51) underpinning the symbolic order as the universe of other signifiers (52), is a bluff, fake, fiction, illusion, myth, semblance, and so on.ll2 The entire Symbolic big Other constitutes a fantasmatic \"virtual reality\" not entirely governed by what is presumed to be actual concrete being.l13 The late Lacan, in the twenty-fourth seminar, goes so far as to declare that \"the bolic tells nothing but lies.\"1l4 And yet, as Zizek, following Lacan, is fond of reminding his readers, he/she who refuses to be \"taken in\" by the trickery of the signifier-mediated virtual reality of the symbolic order-such a cynical nominalist, empiricist, or positivist \"non-dupe\" stubbornly sticks to beliefs in absolutely singular and unique entities, conceptually unprocessed raw perceptual experience, and brute facts-in-themselves wholly independent of 206 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

In the sixteenth seminar, Lacan distinguishes between \"dupery\" (duperie) and \"deception\" (tromperie), The latter implies a standard of representational accuracy or faithfulness vis-a.-vis an extrarepresentational point of reference. Degrees of deception, in Lacan\\'s specific sense, are measured according to the criteria of a correspondence theory of truth. As he rightly observes, analysis is not in the least bit invested in a correspondence theory of truth, at least as it\\'s commonly construed. Analysts aren\\'t (or, at least, shouldn\\'t be) occupied with speculations about the representational veracity of, say, hood memories or depictions of recent events transpiring off the couch outside the analytic consulting room. One could say that analysis concerns itself more with a coherence theory of truth, with the consistencies and inconsistencies of the networks of associative connections internal to the webs of analysands\\' monologues. Whether the nodes in these verbal networks are realistic tions or fictitious fantasies is both unknowable within the framework of an analysis and ultimately unimportant to its long-term progress. For example, an analysand who consistently lies to his/her analyst, fabricating all of his/her reported dreams, fantasies, and so on, still discloses to the analyst the truths of his/her unconscious, telling \"true lies\" despite him-/herself insofar as the very selection of the fabricated verbal material cannot help but be itself ing; such an inadvertent \"telling the truth in the guise oflying\" would be the mirror-image correlate of the Lacanian notion of \"lying in the guise of truth.\" This is one very Freudian reverberation of Lac an\\'s opening line from his sion appearance: \"I always speak the truth\" (\\'\\'Ie dis toujours fa veriti\"),117 the \"I\" AFFECTS ARE SIGNIFIERS Ł 207 ',\n",

Generally speaking, he reduces affects to felt feelings (Empjindungen) and characterizes such consciously registered sentiments (or senti-ments) as either opaque signals confusedly gesturing at a reality of a different order than their own (i.e., rhe unconscious \"other scene\" composed of signifiers as nonaffective ideational representations [Vorstellungen]) or the red herrings of affictuations disguising and concealing repressed signifying structures. In a sense, Lacan judges affects according to a correspondence theory of truth, albeit one internal to the (in)coherent chical reality\" of the parletre talking on rhe couch: the relative truth or falsity, honesty or dishonesty, of affects (as felt feelings) is measured against the dards of signifiers (as purportedly different in kind from feelings). Another angle of approach to these issues is to observe that, from Lacan\\'s perspective, signifiers and affects both can be misleading, although rhey lead in utterly distinct modes. In this view, affects tend to mislead at the level of why they are, but not what they are. When one feels angry, sad, and so on, what\\'s misleading is not the qualitative phenomenal feel of the feeling per se, but rather the true (unfeeling) causes, logics, objects, and reasons (all ated within nonaffective representational registers) responsible for the gence in conscious experience of this feeling state-and this insofar as Lacan, as already noted (in chapter II), regularly argues that affects, limited to rhe status of felt feelings and nothing more, are only ever displaced within sciousness along unfurling chains of signifiers, some of which are repressed or unconscious in ways that affects, according to him, cannot be repressed or unconscious. Lacan\\'s psychoanalytic appropriation of Saussurian linguistics combines, among orher things, Saussure\\'s definition of the signifier as a purely differential (non) entity determined by its relations with other such ties and Freud\\'s psychoanalytic thesis that representational contents and ciative connections in mental life-for Lacan, rhese contents are signifiers and these connections are their relations-can be (and often are) unconscious.

If a signifier is what it is virtue of the sum total its differential relations with other signifiers, and if repression and other defense mechanisms delineated by psychoanalysis are able to render one or more of these other nifiers unconscious, then consciousness can be misled (or duped) about what a given signifier really is if some of this signifier\\'s co-determining relations with repressed other signifiers are unknown to this same consciousness. The entire preceding project, especially through its return to the textual details of Freud\\'s discussions of affective phenomena and explorations of rent affective neuroscience, undermines this Lacanian fashion of ating between affects and signifiers. In the combined lights of Freud and the neurosciences, if the term affict refers to much more than just consciously felt feelings (i.e., Freudian Empfindungen, as distinct from Affikte and Gefohle), then a very disturbing, unsettling truth reveals itself: affects can and do mislead at the level of not only why they are, but what they are, that is, how they feel. In a Hegelian-style formulation, perhaps it could be said that the distinction between affects and signifiers is a distinction internal to the category of the Signifier itself With respect to Lacan, this formulation isn\\'t as objectionable as it might seem at first glance. To cut a long story short, Lacan\\'s signifier isn\\'t essarily a unit of language as per linguistics. Rather, anything can be a signifier if its status and function rely upon its positions in constellations of synchronic systems and diachronic dynamics in which spatial and temporal differences are decisive. Other materials besides the phonetic and graphic materials of natural languages can and do operate as signifiers as defined by both Lacan and various versions of a post-Saussurian general semiotics.ll9 But, one lingering, nagging question remains: if affects can be signifiers insofar as the category of signifier is a formal rather than a substantial category, then what are affects? During his television appearance, Lacan, in response to Miller drawing attention to the word unconscious, says regarding this master word for psychoanalysis: \"Freud didn\\'t find a better one, and there\\'s no need to go back on it. The disadvantage of this word is that it is negative, which allows one to assume anything at all in the world about it, plus everything else as well. Why not? To that which goes unnoticed, the word everywhere applies just as well as nowhere.\"12o If, as these observations indicate, the problem with the word unconscious is that it\\'s a negative term (un-) for a positive x-Lacan immediately adds, \"It is nonetheless a very precise thing\"121-the problem with the word affict might be the exact opposite: it\\'s a positive tGrm for a negative x, namely, the absence of a coherent concept referring, in a precise one-to-one AFFECTS ARE SIGNIFIERS Ł 209 ',\n",
       " \"to identHiable set of phenomena. Even drawing boundary lines circumscribing a general domain that would be the realm of the affects proper (as manifestly distinct from other things) is incredibly tricky and uncertain. And yet, just as Lacan chooses not to jettison the word unconscious despite its noted drawbacks, maybe the fuzzy word affict ought to be retained precisely because the realities it designates are themselves fuzzy. If affict is indeed a positive term for a negative x, this negativity isn't merely ical-representational (i.e., a deficiency or lack at the level of the concept alone). Redeploying the distinctions between emotions and various shades and sorts offeelings uncovered by recent affective neuroscience, one should perhaps retain the term ajfict precisely to designate the uniquely human zations between emotions and feelings as well as among feelings themselves, that is, the actual, palpable absences of in-synch harmonies afflicting the ies, brains, and psyches of partially denaturalized subjects of signifiers. For such subjects, affective life must be lived under the permanent shadow of doubts about passions and sentiments as self-evident, self-transparent, and self-sufficient experiences. Reflexive self-consciousness, thanks to the reflexivity of feeling itself, never will seize upon solid guarantees vouching for the ultimate, final truths of why it feels, how it feels, or even what it feels. A lot can happen in the gaps between emotions, feelings, and the feelings of feelings. With the combined resources of Lacan's Freudian foundations and the rapidly lating findings of the neurosciences, the time is ripe for Lacanian explorations in both psychoanalysis and neurobiology of this terrain that no longer ably can be neglected. 2.10 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS \",\n",

It is this confrontation that our work undertakes here, a work insisting on the importance of the new libidinal economy currently emerging at the intersection of these disciplines and revealing new definitions of affects. The most striking affirmations of contemporary neurobiologists like sio or LeDoux concern the importance of the emotional brain. All the tive operations closely depend on it. Affects function initially at a primitive biological and cerebral level that does not involve consciousness. There fore exists non conscious affects, and the brain is their place of origin.

For one thing, this is because, for Freud as for Lacan, emotions and feelings cannot but be scious. This is why emotions and feelings can be displaced or inhibited, but never repressed. In other words, and paradoxically, the unconscious, where the pleasure principle is located, is little concerned with affects as such. In his metapsychological writings, Freud declares, in 1915, that it is herent to assume the existence of unconscious affects. How could one feel something without being conscious of it? In response to this question appears Johnston\\'s very beautiful formulation: How can there be seen to be something like misftlt ftelings? How can it be supposed that \"one can feel without feeling that one feels, namely, that there can be, so to speak, unfelt (or, more accurately, misfelt) feelings?\" Lacan will return to this Freudian position in affirming that feelings, if they merit their name, cannot but be experienced in ness and that neither unconscious nor, thus, \"misfelt\" feelings exist. As is well known, Lacan takes care to distinguish between, on the one hand, affects, which always are conscious, and, on the other hand, signifiers, which truly and totally constitute the register of the unconscious. An \"affective\" unconscious therefore is nonsense. All the same, from 1907 on, Freud circles around the possibility of ting the existence of \"an unconscious feeling of guilt:\\' an idea picked back up in \"The Unconscious\" of 1915. We should remember that the third section of that metapsychological essay is entitled \"Unconscious Emotions.\" less, after having envisaged this hypothesis, Freud pushes it aside. He employs some very interesting terms that he never takes the trouble to define and guish, such as affective structures (Affektbildungen), affects (Affekte), emotions ( Gefuhle), and ftelings (Empjindungen). In much later texts, like The Ego and the Id (1923), Freud speaks again of an \"unconscious sense of guilt:\\' He seems at this point to recognize, in the second topography, a structural relationship of the unconscious with affects via the feeling of guilt. He already had opened the possibility of such a feeling in texts such as \"Some Character-Types Met with in Psycho-Analytic Work\" of 1916 (in the section entitled \"Criminals from a Sense of Guilt\"), where there appears a feeling of gUilt certainly conscious but where that consciousness does not know what this guilt is about: an obscure guilt that is unaware ofitsel£ This unconscious feeling of guilt is able to manifest itself also in the form of a diffuse anxiety originating from the superego. Guilt even is lated to a \"topographical variety of anxiety.\" Freudthus considers that guilt 2.12. Ł POSTFACE ',\n",
       " 'perhaps can be a \"misfelt feeling\" which gives itself to be felt as an ness, a dissatisfaction-once again, as an anxiety that is vague and without apparent object. Lacan seems more radical still than the Freud of the first topography in terms of negating the existence of unconscious feelings or affects. In the seminar The Ethics of Psychoanalysis, he denounces the confused nature of the recourse to affects and the mixing together of representations and affects. The latter play only a secondary role in relation to the unconscious. It is not a question of fusing affects and the ideational representations they can merely accompany. There is no representational rapport between affect and signifier. In reality, Lacan\\'s position is more nuanced. In the tenth seminar, Anxiety, he correctly states that anxiety is an affect, an affect that it really is necessary to call unconscious. And, perhaps it is possible to reconcile here what Lacan calls asenti-ment, playing with the two verbs sentir (to feel) andmentir (to lie), with what Johnston names a \"misfelt feeling.\" Anxiety does not know in the face of what it is anxious. For this reason, like guilt, it manifests itself as an uneasiness, as a dissatisfaction more than as an affect that is clear and perfectly certain of its object. Consequently, anxiety is well defined as \"the central affect, the one around which everything is organized,\" the \"fundamental affect.\" If psychoanalysis ends with recognizing the importance of affects, can one now envision possible points of passage between psychoanalysis and contemporary neurobiology? The problem is that psychoanalysis has never admitted the tral importance of cerebral activity in psychical functioning. Freud never contested the appropriateness of the metaphor of the brain as an \"electrical center\" developed by Breuer in the Studies on Hysteria. ing to this metaphor, the brain is a pure and simple place where the sion of energy occurs, a simple mechanism. Breuer declares: We ought not to think of a cerebral path of conduction as resembling a phone wire which is only excited electrically at the moment at which it has to function (that is, in the present context, when it has to transmit a signal). We ought to liken it to a telephone line through which there is a constant flow of galvanic current and which can no longer be excited if that current ceases.

It is not equipped with any structure of fluidification via detour-that is to say, via differentiation (dijforenciation )-of energy. In other words, it does not enjoy any mechanism of representation. Lacan will affirm exactly the same thing: the brain, a purely biological and organic entity, is not endowed with representations. Thus, for Freud as for Lacan, the drive (Trieb, pulsion) is never a cerebral given. The \"thrust\" (poussee) of the drive, despite the urgency of the pressure it exerts, does not effectively manifest itself, as Johnston recalls, except by resentation or delegation. At its temporal origins, it splits itself into a sioning power (mandateur) and its commissioned proxy (mandataire). The drive then sends representatives in order to say that it cannot wait. It is this representative structure that qualifies and characterizes the particular rapport between the somatic and the psychical which is at work in the drive\\'s structure. Freud develops on this point two conceptions that are contradictory only in appearance. According to Laplanche and Pontalis, \"Sometimes the instinct [la pulsion] itself is presented as \\'the psychical representative of the stimuli nating from within the organism and reaching the mind: At other times the instinct becomes part of the process of somatic excitation, in which case it is represented in the psyche by \\'instinctual representatives\\' [les representants de la pulsion] which comprise two elements-the ideational representative lungsreprdsentanz, representant-representation] and the quota of affect.\"4 214 Ł POSTFACE ',\n",

The cut or separation between the two, obtained by repression, is hence the sole possible solution to the excess of stressful endogenous urgings: division, procrastinating, and delaying permit deferring (differer) the pressure of the inside without voking \"short circuits.\" From the perspective of Freudian-Lacanian psychoanalysis, this separation provoked by repression certainly cannot be the result of a biological operation.s In effect, for the cut to take place, it is necessary that psychical energy detach itself from neural (nerveuse) energy. The vicissitudes of the drives-\"reversal into its opposite, turning round upon the subject\\'s own self, repression, mation\"6-assume a place other than the cerebral topography. Psychical energy is, in a way, the rhetorical detour of neural energy. Unable to discharge itself in the nervous system, endogenous excitation makes detours comparable to the tropes or figures of discourse. Because, for Freud, symbolic activity does not exist in the nervous system, psychical energy represents this very absence in a style that is foreign to the brain. This brain does not have any initiative in the treatment of an energy it can only transmit and maintain at a constant level to the extent that this is possible? \"Psychical\" energy therefore comes to reveal the absence of a tional and symbolic power in cerebral organization. The nervous system, of which the first task is to master excitations, does not represent the relation of representation that originally unites and divides the psyche and the body. It does not develop representations of the \"sources of internal excitation of the organism.\" Insofar as it cannot affect itself, it also is not a psyche. In Freud\\'s thinking, as is known, sexuality does not designate primarily the sexual drives or sexual life, but actually a certain regime of events governed by a specific causality. Now, this causality finds its source in the possibility of the cut-this cut is at work in every drive, sexual or not (the drives are all similar qualitatively, writes Freud)-between representation and affect.

The exogenous event, when it happens, necessarily finds itself separated from its very exteriority in enlisting itself in the endogenous adventure of meaning (sens). Thus, one will not be surprised that what \"libido\" (qua affect related initially to the sexual drive stricto sensu) ends up designating, in Freud, is the mobility or the \"rhetoric\" of the quota of affect in general. In the same manner that there exists an \"enlarged\" meaning of sexuality (as a type of causality and specific regime of events), there also exists, by way of consequence, an \"enlarged\" sense of the word libido. The mobile character of the libido, which renders it tible to detours, becomes the dominant trait of psychical energy as a whole. The treatment of the sexual drive becomes paradigmatic for every drive vicissitude. Lacan shows that the libido, far from being only a dynamic manifestation of the sexual drive, designates, in fact, \"an undifferentiated quantitative unit ceptible of entering into relations of equivalence.\"8 Even if, as one will see later on here, it is far from being the only psychical energy at work in the psyche, the libido gives its name to every energetic transaction. \"Hence one would talk;\\' Lacan continues, \"of transformations, regressions, fixations, sublimations of the libido, a single term which is conceived of quantitatively.\"9The libido therefore truly has for its function the unification of afield (champ )-not simply that of different phases and structures of sexual development, but also, and precisely, that of the \"field of psychoanalytic effects\" (champ des ejfets psychanalytiques) in general, the energetic tropes or tropisms that go beyond the organization of the nervous system.1O Contemporary neurobiological discoveries put into question these analytic notions. The Freudian conception of a brain foreign to symbolic activity, a brain that is a purely material base without autonomy in the treatment of its own energetic urgings, is in the process of totally disappearing today. trary to what the psychoanalysts affirm, the \"emotional brain\" is apt to support endogenous excitations or drives. In light of this fact, the frontiers between, on the one side, the brain and the cerebral organization and, on the other side, the psychical apparatus and the unconscious find themselves reelaborated. 216 Ł POSTFACE ',\n",

Emotion, according to its literal sense, designates a relational dynamic between brain and body, the very movement of the somatic totality, comprises \\nan individual body and a nervous system. It is this totality in movement that, as I have shown in my text, Damasio interprets in terms of conatus. Between the nervous system and the body a constant exchange of information takes place (which draws these \"maps\" of which we spoke much earlier). In fact, only one word is needed in order \\nto deSignate the two entities: organism, which refers as much to cerebral organization as to bodily structure. The dynamic of emotion has its origin precisely in this elementary activity of exchange of information and autoregulation of the organism. In the ning, emotion does not designate this or that passion, but actually is a cess at work in vital regulation. There is consequently a sort of pure emotion of vitality, without any object other than the \"self,\\' namely, the cerebral \"self:\\' which Damasio calls the \"protoself\" Far from being a mechanical energetic process, comparable to the ing of an electrical switchboard or telephone exchange, homeostasis, the self\\'s information about itself and the maintenance of life, is an affective and tional economy-something psychoanalysis has never envisaged. The maintenance of excitation at its lowest level, necessary for the survival and elementary activity of the system, is the producer of affects: the brain affects itself in regulating life. There is therefore no \"principle of inertia\" -this is the name Freud gives to the principle of constancy-without emotion, that is to say, without the autoaffection of the mechanism that produces the tenance of the system. \"Curiously enough;\\' writes Damasio, \"emotions are part and parcel of the regulation we call homeostasis.\"ll We thus arrive at this ishing paradox: maintenance, constancy, inertia, and homeostasis are the ucts of an autoexcitation. The \"emotional brain\" must be understood precisely starting from this paradox. The emotions organize and coordinate cerebral activity. Whether cerning primary emotions (sadness, joy, fear, surprise, disgust), secondary or \"social\" emotions (embarrassment, jealousy, guilt, pride), or even emotions said to be \"in the background\" (well-being, uneasiness, calm, despondency), the emotions are all elaborate ensuing continuations of affective processes at work in homeostatic regulation.

Even Damasio insists that pleasure is not exactly an emotion, although, unlike Freud, he ties the pleasure-pain spectrum quite closely to affective ena.13 Moreover, Damasio affirms that emotion is a reflexive structure through which vital regulation affects itself: \"the status oflife regulation is expressed in the form of affects:\\'14 The cerebral sites that produce emotion occupy a zone which starts at the level of the brain stem and goes up to the cortex. Outside of a part of the tal lobe called the prefrontal ventromedial cortex, the majority of these sites are subcortical-sites that Freud had considered as being without relation to the unconscious. The principle subcortical sites are located in regions of the brain stem, the hypothalamus, and the basal telencephalon. The amygdala, or the amygdala complex-this is the almond-shaped \\ngroup of neurons situated in the temporal lobe in front of the hippocampus-is equally a determinant subcortical site in the triggering of emotions. It forms that part of the limbic system implicated notably in fear and aggression. What the anatomy of the relation between the triggering and execution of emotions shows is that the distribution of emotional processes over many sites permits the brain to discipline and treat the internal sources of excitation out being overwhelmed by them, without producing, contrary to what Breuer affirms, \"short circuits.\" These sites are not rigid and fixed, but instead stitute functional systems. Damasio emphasizes that \"none of these triggering sites produces an emotion by itself For an emotion to occur the site must cause subsequent activity in other sites .... As with any other form of complex ior, emotion results from the concerted participation of several sites within a brain\\'s system.\"lS It is hence clear that the intensity of internal sources of tion is treated from within the nervous system in a functional and interactive manner that assumes the collaboration of many sites.

This change of conception has considerable consequences, since it has to do with nothing less than a change in the very meaning of the unconscious. We do not seek here to situate biologically this unconscious \\nin opposing tion and drive. Researchers such as Mark Solms, for example, categorically refuse to localize the unconscious. In any case, writes Solms, it is not a question of saying that \"the unconscious is located in the right hemisphere\" nor that it merges with the inductive sites for emotions. If a cerebral unconscious exists, related to the emotional brain, then it necessarily is, like the emotional brain, also a distributed functional system and, consequently, cannot be situated in this or that anatomical \"region.\" All the same, anatomy plays a major role here. To insist on the biological spatiality of the sites for emotion permits establishing that the cerebral scious is first of all related both to the brain\\'s treatment of internal excitations as well as to the autorepresentative activity that is tied to this treatment there. This unconscious is constituted by the \"core\" (noyau) that corresponds to the neuronal elaboration of a representation, constant and changing, of the chosomatic rapport and that determines the original, primitive attachment of the attachment to life. The representative activity internal to the brain and the unconscious responds to a certain type of image-making (mise en image). Damasio writes: \"core consciousness occurs when the brain\\'s representation devices generate an imaged, nonverbal account of how the organism\\'s own state is aJficted by the organism\\'s processing of an object:\\'16 This cartography of the relationship between the inside and the outside reveals the biological history of the ism \"caught in the act of representing its own changing state as it goes about representing something else.\" 17 The core \"protosel£\" the primitive form of identity, is therefore a stant interaction between the internal milieu and the external world.

This ceaselessly maintained first-order collection of neural patterns occurs not in one brain place but in many, at a multiplicity of levels, from the brain stem to the cerebral cortex, in tures that are interconnected by neural pathways. These structures are mately involved in the process of regulating the state of the organism. The operation of acting on the organism and of sensing the state of the organism are closely tied.\"18 The devices described here form part of a set of structures that ously regulate and represent bodily states. Therefore, in the brain, there is no regulation without representation. This double economy precisely defines bral identity as a constant synthesis of different states of relation between body and psyche, as an equilibrium, in a word, of the organism. A question poses itself at this moment of the analysis: Is not defining the scious as a nonconscious activity to fall back into the famous trap, denounced by Freud, that consists in conflating the unconscious (Unbewujt) and the conscious (Bewujtlos)? Would this not be to remain outside the significance of the psychical unconscious? It is certain that if one simply characterizes the cerebral unconscious as the nonconscious place where homeostatic processes are afoot, one risks, in effect, falling into this trap and clinging to an insufficient and uncritically pre-ian definition of the unconscious. Things proceed entirely otherwise if one calls \"cerebral unconscious\" the \"cerebralization\" of ajfects,l9 that is to say, an active and sui generis process of regulation. All the data that the brain gives (itself) on the internal state of the organism and on the relations of the organism with objects is accompanied by the production of affects. The autorepresentative activity of the brain, which ceaselessly maps psychosomatic states, hence tinizes its own inside, putting it into images and affecting itself by this activity of which it is, as seen, the receiver and addressee.

The logic of cerebral autoaffection does not presume the intervention of an extra supplementary energy that is endowed with the status of the libido. The distinction between the self (moi) and the object appears before any and every narcissism and sexual investment. The psychical apparatus appears hence as the core that gathers together, in the same energetic economy, the constant exigency of survival, the relation to self, and the desire of the other. How can one comprehend more exactly the concept of the brain's fection? Traditionally, as I have shown in my analysis of wonder, the notion of autoaffection designates, in philosophy, the original and paradoxical manner in which the subject feels itself to be identical to itself in addressing itself to itself as to another in the strange space of its inner depths. It has to do with a sort of primordial touching of self-the subject senses itself, speaks itself, hears itself speaking, experiences the succession of states of consciousness. This tact produces the difference of self to self without which, paradoxically, there would be neither identity nor permanence. Autoaffection is the original power of the subject to interpellate itself, to autosolicit itself and constitute itself as a subject in this double movement of identity and alrerity to self Homeostatic regulation is, in a certain sense, a mirroring structure of larity within which the brain informs itself of itselpo Emotion plays a mental role in the constitution of this cerebral psyche: the brain affects itself, that is to say, modifies itself in the constant course of vital regulation. The stakes of neurobiological research consist in drawing out from the elementary rapport of the brain with itself and with the other the idea of a cerebral identity that is the unconscious part of subjectivity. This is the paradox that I have sought to illuminate in my essay: fection is not opposed to the idea of the unconscious; instead, the former constitutes the latter. In this resides one of the most important teachings of contemporary neurobiology. Cerebral autoaffection is not of the same nature as the autoaffection of a subject such as philosophers define it. Cerebral fection does not redouble its specularity up to the point of giving itself the form of consciousness. Nobody feels his/her brain-nobody any longer speaks to him-/herself of it, hears him-/herself speak of it, or hears him-/herself in it. Cerebral autoaffection is paradoxically and necessarily accompanied by an impassibility and neutrality of the conscious subject as regards it. If the subject POSTFACE Ł 221 \",\n",
       " 'can affect itself, it is thanks to the brain: the first contact with the self that is homeostasis renders this contact possible. at the same time, this original solicitation dissimulates itself in the very thing that it makes possible. My brain never appears in my inner depths. The brain is not visible except in an objective manner through the snapshots produced by brain-imaging niques. Hence, original emotions remain forever lost for consciousness. But, this does not signify that the cerebral unconscious limits itself solely to the nonconscious. In effect, an entire history hides itself in primitive emotions, and it is evident that events lived by the subject playa role in cerebral autoaffection in the manner in which the conatus informs and maintains itself. The neurobiologists seem in other places sometimes to recognize a certain proximity between the functioning of the protoself and the ego (moi) of the Freudian second topography.21 The ego, like core consciousness, effectively appears as a perceptive surface where internal excitations and external demands meet each other coming from opposite directions. Jaak Panksepp elsewhere defines the protoself as a \"Simple Ego-like Life Form\" (SELF). \\nSolms ments that \"this primal SELF forms the foundational \\'ego\\' upon which all our more complex representations of our selves are built.\"22 The \"ego\" of Freud and the \"self\" (soi) of the neurobiologists have the common characteristic of being frontier or limit concepts between the perception of internal states and the perception of external events, interfaces between inner sensations, sensibility, and mobility. But, the analogy brings itself to a halt abruptly. Damasio point-blank compares the self to a \"homunculus:\\' this \"little man\" that many gists and neurologists-Freud included-have conceived of as \"inhabiting\" the interior of the ego. In The Ego and the Jd, Freud declares that, as regards the ego, \"If we wish to find an anatomical analogy for it we can best identify it with the \\'cortical homunculus\\' of the anatomists, which stands on its head in the cortex, sticks up its heels, faces backwards and, as we know, has its speech-area on the left-hand side.\"23 The homunculus corresponds to a figural representation of a part of the nervous system. There is, in a sense, a sort of subject in the subject, devoted to interpreting the images and representations formed in the brain.24 Damasio affirms that \"the protoself\" is not \"to be confused with the rigid homunculus of old neurology.\"25 It is necessary to avoid this confusion to the extent that \"the proto-self does not occur in one place only, and it emerges dynamically and continuously out of multifarious interacting Signals that span varied orders of the nervous system. Besides, the proto-self is not an interpreter 222 Ł POSTFACE ',\n",

In the brain, affect does not cut itself off from its own energy, does not egate or metaphorize itsel£ But, it is not, for all that, an expression of a unity. In effect, the \"self\" is not substantial. Its manifestation is fundamentally temporal. The self is not what it is except inasmuch as it endures and fabricates itself at each instant: \"The story contained in the images of core consciousness is not told by some clever homunculus. Nor is the story really told by you as a self because the core you is only born as the story is told, within the story itself. You exist as a mental being when primordial stories are being told, and only then; as long as primordial stories are being told, and only then. You are the music while the music lasts.\"27 Cerebral autoaffection is the biological process, both logical and affective, by which finitude is constituted in the core of subjectivity without ever being able to become, at the same time, the knowledge (sa voir) of the subject. The cerebral self has no presence-to-sel£ In this sense, it is always anonymous; it is no one in wholly being the most elementary form of identity. It is thus possible to measure the entire distance that separates the nal unconscious from the unconscious as traditionally defined. The former merges in a certain fashion with the passage of time, whereas the latter ignores time. Freud writes, \"The processes of the system Ucs. are timeless; i.e. they are not ordered temporally, are not altered by the passage of time; they have no reference to time at all. Reference to time is bound up ... with the work of the system CS.\"28 To these assertions are related those according to which the unconscious does not know death: \"Our unconscious, then, does not believe in its own death; it behaves as if it were immortal.\"29 By contrast, cerebral autoaffection is the announcement and the incessant internal reminder of mortality. Damasio declares, \"We do not have a self sculpted in stone and, like stone, resistant to the ravages of time. Our sense of self is a state of the organism, the result of certain components operating in a certain manner and interacting in a certain way, within certain parameters. It is another struction, a vulnerable pattern of integrated operations whose consequence is to generate the mental representation of a living individual being.

I have perhaps been more negative than Adrian in my critique of sis here. He departs from a recognition, by Freud and by Lacan, of misfelt ings and concludes from this that there is a point of common passage between analysis and neurobiology. I certainly also think this, but I believe that it is necessary to insist all the same that the contempt of psychoanalysis vis-a-vis the brain and neurobiology in general has been erroneous. This lack of regard is also shared with contemporary philosophy, something that I have, for my part, tried to show. Despite everything, the recent teachings of the neurobiological approach to emotions permit us, Adrian as well as me, to revisit the two traditions of psychoanalysis and philosophy with a new gaze and to discover there theses or positions on the subject of affects that had not necessarily been discovered previously. The cutting edge of the cerebral unconscious passes through anxiety to wonder, an unconscious via which, as we teach, one can become a stranger to oneself at any moment, as well as a stranger to every kind of tradition that one believes to be immortal. Today, a new subject arrives in the world, a subject potentially denuded of the feeling of guilt, of wonder, of the capacity for prise, of moral sentiments. Is it only the sick subject that presents itself thus? Where is the new face of the unconscious? Contemporary neurobiology is caught up in this paradox: insisting on the fundamental importance of affects, it describes their possible loss.

Freud\\'s affirmations hence clarify themselves, according to which \"research has given irrefutable proof that mental activity is bound up with the function of the brain as it is with no other organ. We are taken a step further-we do not know how much-by the discovery of the unequal importance of the different parts of the brain and their special relations to particular parts of the body and to particular mental activities. But every attempt to go on from there to discover a localization of mental processes, every endeavour to think of ideas as stored up in nerve-cells and of excitations as elling along nerve-fibres, has miscarried completely.

Everything that lies between is unknown to us, and the data do not include any direct relation between these two terminal points of our knowledge.

       "'The brain has always been described by means of techno- logical metaphors: as an apparatus relaying excitation with the precision of a mirror reflecting light, as a hydraulic pump driving animal spirits into the muscles, as a central telephone exchange connecting or cutting off communica- tion; in the digital age, as a computer running its programs. These metaphors, as Catherine Malabou remarks, proceed from a centralizing concept of the brain seen as a machine that works from the top down, that orders movement, con- trols behavior, and brings about a unity of mind, conscious- ness, and man. In an earlier day, this centralizing and unifying vision truly represented an ideal of governance: one sole leader, one sole head commanding and organizing everything. We recall the difficulties faced during the Napo- leonic era by Franz Josef Gall. His system, subdividing the mind into faculties distributed among different areas of the brain, was seen by the ruling powers as a threat to the unity and stability of the state. \\nBrain plasticity shatters this concept. The machine learns, differentiates itself, reconstructs itself. Briefly put, it privileges the event over the law. Omnipresent plasticity changes our view of the brain and its functioning. But Ma- labou goes further, seeking to show that the transition from a wired brain to a plastic brain is really the transition from a ‘‘brain-machine’’ to a ‘‘brain-world.’’ According to her, this change in perspective would affect not merely the model of cerebral functioning but also the concept we forge of ourselves and our social organization. The new model of the brain progressively elucidated by modern neuroscience emerges in a particular context: it co-occurs with a radical modification of the economic and social environment. The look of capitalism has changed, passing from a planned sys- tem, managed from above and overseen by a central author- ity, to an auto-organization at once dynamic, multipolar, and adaptive to circumstance. This new model of organiza- tion clearly suggests an analogy with cerebral reality: ‘‘Like neuronal cohesion, contemporary corporate economic and social organization is not of a central or centralizing type but rests on a plurality of mobile and atomistic centers, de- ployed according to a connectionist model’’ (p. 42). Might we have a ‘‘neo-liberal’’ brain that would impose its model on our socioeconomic organization? Or, inversely, might the global economy’s upheaval generate a conceptual change that would affect, by contagion, our view of the way the brain functions? \\nThe analogy between the functioning of a modern busi- ness enterprise and a brain is truly striking: in both cases, decision-making centers are distributed, and networks undo and recompose themselves according to tasks to be accomplished and goals to be realized. But this analogy has limits: in the brain, delocalization is not total, or, rather, localization is not fortuitous. It depends upon a connective organization emplaced at the embryonic phase. Each re- gion, of the cortex in particular, therefore possesses a de facto specialization, determined by its connections and its position in the information-processing line. Thus the perti- nent model would have a character more subsidiary than pluricompetent. Pathological focal lesions show that the al- teration of a particular function (language processing, for example) can leave others intact (music processing). Simi- larly, the reuse of an intact zone to supplement a lesional zone works in very limited ways. Restoring a damaged net- work through a substitutive operation comes at the price of despecialization and performance loss. In the case of a sys- temic illness giving rise to depression, despecialization man- ifests itself as disaffiliation, a rupture in the social bond, placing the individual outside the network. Malabou rightly draws a parallel between illnesses of social connection, such as depression, and neurodegenerative illnesses, such as Alz- heimer’s dementia. Both cases involve a disconnection from the rest of the network. In one case, reconnection is possi- ble; in the other, it is not. This is how dementia appears as the countermodel of plasticity: the irreparable loss of con- nections at the core of the cerebral network entails a defini- tive disconnection from the social network. \\nThe analogy between cerebral organization and socioeco- nomic organization should thus, at the very least, lead us to an awareness of the relation between the subject and his brain. Abandoning the thesis of a rigid, predetermined, di- recting organ for the thesis of a supple, adaptable, plastic organ permits the political emancipation of the brain, the transition from a ‘‘soviet’’ to a ‘‘liberal’’ brain. But what is the consequence of this conceptual reversal for each indi- vidual? The brain itself has not changed. Humans in the  Middle Ages, the Industrial Revolution, and the liberal rev- olution all have had the same brain, with the same capaci- ties for learning and adaptation. What changes is the organization of society, the outcome of organizational forces and macroscopic interactions over which the brain has little influence. Thus the problem is, rather, that of un- derstanding how an individual brain can respond to the challenges of its social environment. \\nMalabou positions her book at the center of this ques- tioning. For her, the brain makes possible the fundamental organic coherence of our personality, our self. The self is the result, the reflection, of the ordered functioning of the neuronal networks comprising the brain. This, in the end, guarantees the internal coherence of our representations. By guaranteeing the synthesis of the neuronal and the mental, the brain regulates the homeostasis of our mental states, just as, on another level, we have a regulation of the internal milieu maintaining the unity of the organism. We clearly have no consciousness of the plastic mechanisms forming our personality and guaranteeing its continuity. Yet by try- ing to become conscious of them we may, Malabou pro- poses, acquire a new freedom, that of imposing our own organization on the world rather than submitting to the in- fluences of a milieu. Plasticity, in effect, is not flexibility. Let us not forget that plasticity is a mechanism for adapting, while flexibility is a mechanism for submitting. Adapting is not submitting, and, in this sense, plasticity ought not to serve as an alibi for submitting to the new world order being dreamed up by capitalism. ‘‘Not to replicate the cari- cature of the world: this is what we should do with our brain’’ (p. 78). To be conscious of the plasticity of one’s brain is to give oneself the means to say no. \\n\\nPlasticity and Flexibility—For a Consciousness of the Brain \\nThe brain is a work, and we do not know it. We are its subjects—authors and products at once—and we do not know it. ‘‘Humans make their own history, but they do not know that they make it,’’ says Marx, intending thereby to awaken a consciousness of historicity. In a certain way, such words apply precisely to our context and object: ‘‘Humans make their own brain, but they do not know that they make it.’’ It is not a question of effecting a tricky rhetorical move by corrupting this fine phrase for the benefit of our analysis or of acceding to the facility of a formal analogy. Quite the contrary, the bond between brain and history—concepts long taken to be antithetical—is now established with certainty. \\nThe structural bond here is so deep that in a certain sense it defines an identity. It’s not just that the brain has a his- tory—which is sometimes confused with that of its consti- tution as an object of the sciences—but that it is a history. \\nIn fact, today we can say that there exists a constitutive his- toricity of the brain. The aim of this book is precisely to awaken a consciousness of this historicity. It is no longer important to ask whether brain and consciousness are one and the same thing—let us put aside this old and specious debate. Instead we must constitute this strange critical en- tity, at once philosophical, scientific, and political, that would be a consciousness of the brain. It is to the constitution of this new genre—open to everyone—that the question What should we do with our brain? invites us. \\nWe have not yet assimilated the results of the revolution- ary discoveries made over the last fifty years in neurosci- ences (that is to say, the group of disciplines that study the anatomy, physiology, and functioning of the central ner- vous system, or CNS1), results that contribute more every day to the refutation of erroneous yet nonetheless mysteri- ously persistent pictures we still have of the brain. Already in 1979, in the preface to his book Neuronal Man, Jean- Pierre Changeux declared that our knowledge in the field of neurosciences had experienced \\nan expansion matched only by the growth of physics at the beginning of the century and molecular biology in the 1950s. The impact of the discovery of the syn- apse and its functions is comparable to that of the atom or DNA. A new world is emerging, and the time seems ripe to open this field of knowledge to a wider public than the specialists and, if possible, to share the researchers’ enthusiasm.2 \\nBut this communication, this opening to the public at large, this sharing of enthusiasm, never took place. Twenty- five years later, the assessment remains the same: ‘‘The im- passe on the topic of the brain is, with few exceptions, otal.’’3 Even if many things have changed, even if the neu- rosciences have become ‘‘cutting-edge’’ disciplines, even if medical imaging has made palpable progress, even if the ‘‘cognitive sciences’’ have attained the status of autonomous disciplines,4 and even if the number of articles about the CNS in the mainstream press has multiplied, neuronal man still has no consciousness. \\nIn this sense, we are still foreign to ourselves, at the threshold of this ‘‘new world,’’ which we fail to realize makes up our very intimacy itself. ‘‘We’’ have no idea who ‘‘we’’ are, no idea what is inside ‘‘us.’’ Of course, we have all heard people talk about neurons, synapses, connections, networks, different types of memory. Everyone knows about neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s. Many of us have seen, in hospitals, the output screen of a functional neural-imaging machine. Some of us know that today it is possible, thanks to new MRI and PET technologies,5 to observe the brain in vivo, in real time. Everyone says that psychoanalysis is losing importance, and everyone hears talk, right or wrong, about how the only ef- fective cure for nervous depression is the chemical kind. We all know about MAOIs or SSRIs;6 we are vaguely familiar with the words serotonin, noradrenalin, and neurotransmit- ter, and we all know about the neuronal origin of tobacco or drug addiction. We know that it is now possible to suc- cessfully transplant a hand and that the brain can reconsti- tute its bodily schema to include foreign members. We have heard about a certain ability on the part of the nervous sys- tem to repair, at least partially, some of the damage it sus- tains. The word resilience is not unknown to us.7 \\nThe problem is that we do not see the link that unifies all these phenomena, names, and situations, which are here purposefully listed completely at random and appear to have nothing in common with one another. This link exists nonetheless and is tied to the activity of the brain, to its manner of developing itself, of working, of doing. This link is tied to its meaning as a work, our work, and as history, our history, and as a singular destiny, our destiny. \\nThe work proper to the brain that engages with history and individual experience has a name: plasticity. What we have called the constitutive historicity of the brain is really nothing other than its plasticity. The plasticity of the CNS, nervous plasticity, neuronal plasticity, synaptic plasticity—we run into this word in every neurology department of every medical school and of every university hospital, in the name of every neuroscientific research team8—it jumps out at us, in its many occurrences, every time we look under the word brain in the library. It constitutes the name of a specific dis- cipline in scientific journals.9 This frequency and omnipres- ence are not at all contingent. In fact, plasticity is the dominant concept of the neurosciences. Today it consti- tutes their common point of interest, their dominant motif, and their privileged operating model, to the extent that it allows them to think about and describe the brain as at once an unprecedented dynamic, structure, and organization. \\nOur brain is plastic, and we do not know it. We are com- pletely ignorant of this dynamic, this organization, and this structure. We continue to believe in the ‘‘‘rigidity’ of an entirely genetically determined brain,’’10 about which it is obviously completely in vain to ask: What should we do with this? Even the very word brain frightens us: we don’t under- stand anything about it—all these phenomena, all these folds, ridges, valleys, localizations, this jargon that describes (we imagine) a series of fixed, indeed genetically pro- grammed, entities, without any suppleness, without any improvisational ability. We don’t understand this organiza- tion, which gives rise to so many unsettling metaphors in the register of command and government: a controller that sends orders down from on high, a central telephone ex- change, a computer . . . all of this cybernetic frigidity, which only serves to alienate us from consciousness,11 itself the only sign of life and liberty in a domain of implacable organic necessity, where movement and grace seem to be reduced to mere reflex. \\nMeanwhile, plasticity directly contradicts rigidity. It is its exact antonym. In ordinary speech, it designates supple- ness, a faculty for adaptation, the ability to evolve. Accord- ing to its etymology—from the Greek plassein, to mold —the word plasticity has two basic senses: it means at once the capacity to receive form (clay is called ‘‘plastic,’’ for ex- ample) and the capacity to give form (as in the plastic arts or in plastic surgery). Talking about the plasticity of the brain thus amounts to thinking of the brain as something modifiable, ‘‘formable,’’ and formative at the same time. Brain plasticity operates, as we shall see, on three levels: (1) the modeling of neuronal connections (developmental plas- ticity in the embryo and the child); (2) the modification of neuronal connections (the plasticity of synaptic modulation throughout life); and (3) the capacity for repair (post- lesional plasticity). ‘‘Plasticity in the nervous system means an alteration in structure or function brought about by de- velopment, experience, or injury.’’12 \\nBut it must be remarked that plasticity is also the capac- ity to annihilate the very form it is able to receive or create. We should not forget that plastique, from which we get the words plastiquage and plastiquer,13 is an explosive substance made of nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose, capable of caus- ing violent explosions. We thus note that plasticity is situated between two extremes: on the one side the sensible image of taking form (sculpture or plastic objects), and on the other side that of the annihilation of all form (explosion). The word plasticity thus unfolds its meaning between sculptural molding and deflagration, which is to say explo- sion. From this perspective, to talk about the plasticity of the brain means to see in it not only the creator and receiver of form but also an agency of disobedience to every consti- tuted form, a refusal to submit to a model. \\nLet us dwell for a moment on the modeling of neuronal connections, made possible by our individual experience, skills, and life habits, by the power of impression of existence in general. We can now see that the plasticity of the brain, understood in this sense, corresponds well to the possibility of fashioning by memory, to the capacity to shape a history. While the central nervous system’s power for change is par- ticularly clear during the developmental stage, we know for certain that the ability to learn, to acquire new skills and new memories, is maintained throughout life. And this is true in a different way from one individual to the next. The capacity of each to receive and to create his or her own form does not depend on any pre-established form; the original model or standard is, in a way, progressively erased. \\nSynaptic efficacy grows or declines under the impact of strictly individual experience. The synapse—from the Greek sunapsis, ‘‘liaison, juncture’’—is the region of contact or connection between two neurons. The neuron, an ele- mentary unit of nervous tissue, can be divided into three parts: the cellular body (protoplasm), the dendrites, and the axon, which are its extensions. It is by means of these exten- sions that connections (synapses) are established between two neurons. Dendrites, along with the cellular body, con- stitute what we call the postsynaptic side of the neuron. (This is where connections coming from ‘‘upstream’’ neu- rons arrive.) The axon constitutes the presynaptic part of the neuron: its endpoints are in contact with other ‘‘down- stream’’ neurons.14 Marc Jeannerod explains: If a synapse belongs to a circuit in frequent use, it tends to grow in volume, its permeability increases, and its efficacy increases. Inversely, a little-used syn- apse tends to become less efficacious. The theory of synaptic efficacy thus allows us to explain the gradual molding of a brain under the influence of individual experience, to the point of making it possible for us, in principle, to account for the individual characteris- tics and particularities of each brain. We are dealing here with a mechanism of individuation that makes each brain a unique object despite its adherence to a common model.15 \\nIn this sense—we know this by now—the brain of a pianist is not strictly identical to that of a mathematician, a mechanic, or a graphic artist. But it is obviously not just a person’s ‘‘trade’’ or ‘‘specialty’’ that matters here. The entire identity of the individual is in play: her past, her surround- ings, her encounters, her activities; in a word, the ability that our brain—that every brain—has to adapt itself, to in- clude modifications, to receive shocks, and to create anew on the basis of this very reception. It is precisely because— contrary to what we normally think—the brain is not al- ready made that we must ask what we should do with it, what we should do with this plasticity that makes us, pre- cisely in the sense of a work: sculpture, modeling, architec- ture. What should we do with this plastic organic art? It is already known that ‘‘synaptic plasticity, continuing throughout learning, throughout development as well as adulthood, sculpts each of our brains. Education, experi- ence, and training make each brain a unique work.’’16 What should we do with all this potential within us? What should we do with this genetically free field? What should we do with this idea of a truly living brain (modification of synap- tic efficacy, as we will see, is already implicated in the most elementary level of animal life, and thus appears today to be one of the fundamental characteristics of living beings), a fragile brain, which depends on us as much as we depend on it—the dizzying reciprocity of reception, donation, and suspension of form that outlines the new structure of consciousness? \\nWe can now understand why Jean-Pierre Changeux claims that the ‘‘discovery of the synapse and its functions’’ was as revolutionary as the discovery of DNA: the former brings to the latter a level of precision and a modification so significant that it seems almost to contradict it. Brain plasticity constitutes a possible margin of improvisation with regard to genetic necessity. Today it is no longer chance versus necessity, but chance, necessity, and plastic- ity—which is neither the one nor the other. ‘‘We know,’’ says Changeux, ‘‘that the power of genes assures the perpet- uation of broad traits of [cerebral] organization, such as the form of the brain and of its circumvolutions, the organiza- tion of its areas and the general architecture of cerebral tis- sue. . . . But considerable variability . . . remains despite the genes’ power.’’17 If neuronal function is an event or should bring about events, this is so precisely because it is itself able to create events, to eventualize [ ́ev ́enementialiser] the pro- gram and thus, in a certain sense, to deprogram it. \\nWe are living at the hour of neuronal liberation, and we do not know it. An agency within us gives sense to the code, and we do not know it. The difference between the brain and psychism is shrinking considerably, and we do not know it. ‘‘We’’ end up coinciding completely with ‘‘our brain’’—because our brain is us, the intimate form of a ‘‘proto-self,’’18 a sort of organic personality—and we do not know it. Humans make their own brain, but they do not know they are doing so. But why? Why do they not know it? Why do we persist in our belief that the brain is purely and simply a ‘‘ma- chine,’’ a program without promise? Why are we ignorant of our own plasticity? It is not because of a lack of informa- tion; exoteric books on the subject of brain plasticity abound. It is not because of a problem with popularization; we can talk in a very simple way about this plasticity, and that is precisely what this book is going to do. It is not a question of acquaintance but a question, once again, of consciousness. What must we be conscious of (and not merely acquainted with) concerning brain plasticity? What is the nature of its meaning? \\nWe will respond, without playing on words, by saying that the consciousness we want to raise on the subject of plasticity has to do with its power to naturalize conscious- ness and meaning. Clearly, if we are not conscious of plas- ticity this is because, in accordance with a merely apparent paradox, it is in fact so familiar to us that we do not even see it; we do not note its presence, like an environment in which we maintain ourselves and evolve without paying at- tention to it. It has become the form of our world. As Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello note in their remarkable work The New Spirit of Capitalism, neuronal functioning and so- cial functioning interdetermine each other and mutually give each other form (here again the power of plasticity), to the point where it is no longer possible to distinguish them. As though neuronal function were confounded with the natural operation of the world, as though neuronal plastic- ity anchored biologically—and thereby justified—a certain type of political and social organization. This is precisely what is meant by a ‘‘naturalization effect.’’ The authors de- clare that we live in a ‘‘connectionist world with the coher- ence and immediacy of something natural.’’ But this ‘‘naturalization effect is especially powerful in those disci- plines which, aiming to connect biology and society, derive the social bond from implantation in the order of living or- ganisms, or construct their representation of society on the basis of a physiological metaphor—not, as in the old organ- icism, cellular differentiation, but much more today on the metaphor of the neuron with its networks and flows.’’19 \\nHumans make their own brain but they do not know that they do so. We are entirely ignorant of brain plasticity. Yet we are not at all ignorant of a certain kind of organiza- tion of labor—part-time jobs, temporary contracts, the de- mand for absolute mobility and adaptability, the demand for creativity . . . The brain is our work, and we do not know it. Yet we know very well that we live in a reticular society. We have understood that to survive today means to be connected to a network, to be capable of modulating one’s efficacy. We know very well that every loss of supple- ness means rejection, pure and simple. Is the difference really all that great between the picture we have of an un- employed person about to be kicked off the dole and the picture we have of someone suffering from Alzheimer’s? We know already that individuals construct their lives as works, that it is each individual’s responsibility to know what he should do with himself, and that for this he ought not be rigid. There is thus no need, in a certain sense, to be ac- quainted with the results of current discoveries in the neu- rosciences in order to have an immediate, daily experience of the neuronal form of political and social functioning, a form that today deeply coincides with the current face of capitalism. \\nThe reference to Marx at the beginning of our analysis takes on its full importance here. In asking the question What should we do with our brain? we don’t merely want to present the reader with some clarifications about cerebral functioning. Playing on the title of a well-known work by Daniel Dennett, we are not seeking to explain or explicate consciousness, but to implicate it.20 To implicate conscious- ness, to ask what we should do with our brain, means, start- ing from these clarifications, to attempt to develop a critique of what we will call neuronal ideology. It is thus not just a matter of uncovering, in the name of brain plasticity, a certain freedom of the brain but rather, starting from as precise a study as possible of the functioning of this plastic- ity, to free this freedom, to disengage it from a certain num- ber of ideological presuppositions that implicitly govern the entire neuroscientific field and, by a mirror effect, the entire field of politics—and in this way to rescue philosophy from its irresponsible torpor. Philosophers, excepting ‘‘cognitive scientists,’’ are not sufficiently interested in the problem, mostly misunderstand the cognitive sciences, and, in the end, are simply ignorant of the results of recent research on the brain. So they miss the ideological stakes as well. \\nBut What should we do with our brain? is not a question reserved for philosophers, for scientists, or for politi- cians—it is a question for everyone. It should allow us to understand why, given that the brain is plastic, free, we are still always and everywhere ‘‘in chains’’; why, given that the activity of the central nervous system, as it is revealed today in the light of scientific discovery, presents reflection with what is doubtless a completely new conception of transfor- mation, we nonetheless have the feeling that nothing is transformed; and why, given that it is clear that there can no longer be any philosophical, political, or scientific ap- proach to history that does not pass through a close analysis of the neuronal phenomenon, we nonetheless have the feel- ing that we lack a future, and we ask ourselves What good is having a brain, indeed, what should we do with it? \\nThe guiding question of the present effort should thus be formulated: What should we do so that consciousness of the brain does not purely and simply coincide with the spirit of capitalism? We will formulate the following thesis: today, the true sense of plasticity is hidden, and we tend constantly to substitute for it its mistaken cognate, flexibility. The dif- ference between these two terms appears insignificant. Nev- ertheless, flexibility is the ideological avatar of plasticity—at once its mask, its diversion, and its confiscation. We are en- tirely ignorant of plasticity but not at all of flexibility. In this sense, plasticity appears as the coming consciousness of flexibility. At first glance, the meanings of these two terms are the same. Under the heading ‘‘flexibility,’’ the diction- ary gives: ‘‘firstly, the character of that which is flexible, of that which is easily bent (elasticity, suppleness); secondly, the ability to change with ease in order to adapt oneself to the circumstances.’’ The examples given to illustrate the second meaning are those that everybody knows: ‘‘flexibil- ity on the job, of one’s schedule (flex time, conversion), flexible factories.’’ The problem is that these significations grasp only one of the semantic registers of plasticity: that of receiving form. To be flexible is to receive a form or impres- sion, to be able to fold oneself, to take the fold, not to give it.21 To be docile, to not explode. Indeed, what flexibility lacks is the resource of giving form, the power to create, to invent or even to erase an impression, the power to style. Flexibility is plasticity minus its genius.22 \\nHumans make their own brains, and they do not know that they do so. Our brain is a work, and we do not know it. Our brain is plastic, and we do not know it. The reason for this is that most of the time flexibility superimposes it- self on plasticity, even in the midst of scientific discourses that take themselves to be describing it entirely ‘‘objec- tively.’’ The mistake in certain cognitivist discourses, for in- stance, is not that they reduce the mental to the neuronal or the mind to a biological entity. I am myself entirely ma- terialist, and such affirmations do not shock me at all. The error is in thinking that neuronal man is simply a neuronal given and not also a political and ideological construction (including of the ‘‘neuronal’’ itself ). One notes that many descriptions of plasticity are in fact unconscious justifica- tions of a flexibility without limits. Sometimes it seems as though in nervous systems, from the aplysia23 to the human, a faculty is deployed—a faculty described precisely in terms of synaptic plasticity—to fold, to render oneself docile vis-a`-vis one’s environment, in a word, to adapt to everything, to be ready for all adjustments. It is as though, under the pretext of describing synaptic plasticity, we were really looking to show that flexibility is inscribed in the brain, as though we knew more about what we could stand than about what we could create. That said, securing a true plasticity of the brain means insisting on knowing what it can do and not simply what it can tolerate. By the verb to do or to make [ faire] we don’t mean just ‘‘doing’’ math or piano but making its history, becoming the subject of its history, grasping the connection between the role of genetic nondeterminism at work in the constitution of the brain and the possibility of a social and political nondeterminism, in a word, a new freedom, which is to say: a new meaning of history. \\nFlexibility is a vague notion, without tradition, without history, while plasticity is a concept, which is to say: a form of quite precise meanings that bring together and structure particular cases. This concept has a long philosophical past, which has itself remained too long in the shadows. I do not intend to criticize anyone here, and my goal is not polemi- cal. I would simply like to disentangle the notion and the concept, to make us stop taking the one for the other and conflating them, as I have intentionally done above, in speaking simultaneously of nervous depression, hand trans- plants, and lesion repair. I would like to do this in order to stigmatize the definitional magma in which, in the end, we all bathe, the author of this book along with everyone else. Speaking for myself, I would say that I have been interested for a long time in plasticity, whose genesis and whose meaning in the philosophical tradition I have, in previous efforts, attempted to elucidate and reconstitute.24 The study of neuronal plasticity and cerebral functioning, and the reading of important texts by cognitive scientists dedicated to this functioning, have been much more than an enrich- ment for me: they have been a true test as well as a confir- mation, a renewal, and a concretization of the philosophical meaning of plasticity. The critical epistemological exercise carried out in this book thus presents itself as an enterprise of rectification and sharpening of the usage of this concept. \\nBut let us not forget that the question What should we do with our brain? is a question for everyone, that it seeks to give birth in everyone to the feeling of a new responsibility. The inquiry conducted here thus ought, beyond the critical imperatives just announced, to allow anyone who consents to follow its path to think new modalities of forming the self, under the name of ‘‘plasticity’’ and beyond the overly simplistic alternative between rigidity and flexibility. This means asking not ‘‘To what point are we flexible?’’ but rather ‘‘To what extent are we plastic?’’\\n\\nPlasticity’s Fields of Action \\nBetween Determination and Freedom \\nIn mechanics, a material is called plastic if it cannot return to its initial form after undergoing a deformation.1 ‘‘Plastic’’ in this sense is opposed to ‘‘elastic.’’ Plastic material retains an imprint and thereby resists endless polymorphism. This is the case, for instance, with sculpted marble. Once the statue is finished, there is no possible return to the indeter- minacy of the starting point. So plasticity designates solidity as much as suppleness, designates the definitive character of the imprint, of configuration, or of modification. Accord- ing to this first limit or semantic extreme, plasticity, though not altogether assimilable to rigidity, marks a certain deter- mination of form and imposes a (very strict) restriction on the capacity for deformation, re-formation, or explosion. We will see that this somewhat ‘‘closed’’ or restrained signi- fication is essentially at work in the developmental plasticity of neuronal connections tied to the genetic determinism that presides over the constitution of every brain. \\nThe second limit on the range of the concept of plasticity is marked, inversely, by an ‘‘open’’ or unrestrained defini- tion. According to this second limit, plasticity designates a much more effective transformative ability. This involves, not an infinite modifiability—we have not yet come back around to polymorphism—but a possibility of displacing or transforming the mark or the imprint, of changing determi- nation in some way. As an example of such a meaning, let us consider the properties of so-called ‘‘adult’’ stem cells (at work in the adult organism and thereby distinguished from ‘‘embryonic’’ stem cells). Adult stem cells are nonspecial- ized cells found in specialized tissues (the brain, bone mar- row, blood, blood vessels, the retina, the liver, etc.). They renew themselves, and most of them specialize, in order to produce all the types of cells in their tissue of origin that normally die. This is how, for example, immature blood cells are made out of bone marrow stem cells. But while the majority of adult stem cells generate cells similar to those of the tissue they come from, it has been discovered that some of them (notably skin stem cells) can transform themselves into different types of cells (for example, nerve or muscle cells). One then says that they ‘‘transdifferentiate’’ them- selves, that is, literally, that they change their difference.2 \\nThis capacity to differentiate and transdifferentiate themselves is called, precisely, stem-cell plasticity. In the first case—the capacity to differentiate themselves into cells of the same tissue—stem cells are called multipotent.3 In the second case—the capacity to develop themselves into types of cells specific to other tissues—stem cells are called pluri- potent.4 Stem-cell plasticity—which allows us to conceive of a sort of range of differentiation between multipotence and pluripotence—is an extremely striking example, perhaps the very paradigm, of the ‘‘open’’ meaning of plasticity. Ac- cording to this meaning, plasticity designates generally the ability to change one’s destiny, to inflect one’s trajectory, to navigate differently,5 to reform one’s form and not solely to constitute that form as in the ‘‘closed’’ meaning. This open meaning is essentially at work in the plasticity of synaptic modulation, as we will see when we study the interplay of the modification of synaptic connections and ‘‘secondary neurogenesis’’—the renewal of neurons in the adult brain, starting, precisely, from stem cells. \\nThus, with plasticity we are dealing with a concept that is not contradictory but graduated, because the very plastic- ity of its meaning situates it at the extremes of a formal necessity (the irreversible character of formation: determi- nation) and of a remobilization of form (the capacity to form oneself otherwise, to displace, even to nullify determi- nation: freedom). It is this complex, this synthesis, this se- mantic wealth, that we ought to keep in mind throughout our analysis. \\nThe Three Plasticities \\nWe will now look more closely at the biological phenome- non of brain plasticity according to its three major roles: developmental plasticity, modulational plasticity, and re- parative plasticity. \\nDevelopmental Plasticity: The Formation of Neuronal Connections \\nWhat do we find in the brain? Billions of neurons (around twenty billion in humans) connected in a network of innu- merable links, the synapses. ‘‘The human brain,’’ says Changeux, ‘‘makes one think of a gigantic assembly of tens of billions of interlacing neuronal ‘spider’s webs’ in which myriads of electrical impulses flash by, relayed from time to time by a rich array of chemical signals.’’6 These ‘‘spider’s webs,’’ neuronal connections also called ‘‘arborizations,’’ are constituted progressively over the course of an individu- al’s development. We use the term plasticity precisely to characterize this neuronal genesis. The brain, in effect, forms itself. ‘‘The human infant is born with a brain weigh- ing about 300 grams—20 percent of the weight of an adult brain. . . . One of the major features of the development of the human brain, then, is that it continues well after birth, for about 15 years.’’7 \\nEverything begins with establishing connections and then multiplying them and making them more complex. The growth in mass of the brain coincides with the exten- sion of axons and dendrites, the formation of synapses, and the development of myelin sheaths around the axons. This development is subject to strict genetic determinism. As Jeannerod notes, from the point of view of their genesis and their constitution, ‘‘all human brains resemble each other.’’8 The connections that constitute the anatomy of the mature brain are obviously not the result of chance or of spontane- ous arrangement; the migration of nerve cells and their ad- aptation to their targets are programmed. He continues: \\nTo take just one example, the fibers that come from the retina and transport visual information end their journey, in all individuals, in the visual part of the cortex—that is, in the occipital lobe, occupying the rear part of the brain; in all individuals, connections are established between this visual region and other regions situated in the parietal lobe and in the tempo- ral lobe, and so forth. The adult brain therefore re- flects the existence of a pre-established plan that causes brain anatomy to be the same from one indi- vidual to the next.9 \\nBut if neuronal genesis corresponds to a ‘‘pre-established plan,’’ why talk about plasticity in order to characterize this development? For two essential reasons, which, within the context of development, have to do with (1) establishing connections, a process we have just mentioned, and (2) modeling those connections (which ought not to be con- fused with the modulation of synaptic efficacy). In both cases, it is the execution of the genetic program that works in a plastic way. There is a sort of plastic art of the brain— hence the use of the term plasticity in this context. And it is here that the restrained or ‘‘closed’’ signification of the con- cept has to be taken into account: the sculpting of a deter- minate form. \\nIn the course of the process of establishing connections, the sculptor’s chisel is the phenomenon called ‘‘apoptosis’’ or ‘‘cell death.’’ This death is a normal phenomenon. Again it corresponds to the execution of a genetic program, lead- ing to the elimination of useless connections and to the pro- gressive sculpting of the definitive form of the system by fitting nerve fibers to their targets. In the human brain, neu- ronal death begins at the end of gestation and continues after birth, for at least the first six months of life. It contin- ues in adults at a much slower pace. ‘‘This neuronal ‘sacri- fice,’’’ writes Changeux, ‘‘is part of normal development; indeed, it constitutes one of its critical phases.’’10 In an elo- quently titled book, The Sculpture of the Living, Jean- Claude Ameisen insists that the brain, far from being, as was previously believed, an organ fully constituted at birth, simultaneously receives and gives itself form. ‘‘Cell death,’’ he writes, ‘‘is . . . a tool allowing the embryo to work out its form in its becoming, by an eliminative procedure that allies it with sculpture.’’11 \\nFrom this stage of development on, however, once the definitive form of the system has been sculpted, ‘‘genetic determination begins to slacken,’’12 explains Jeannerod. ‘‘After birth, the topographic network put in place during embryogenesis and stabilized by neuronal death and by the elimination of connections begins to function under the in- fluence of external factors. This functioning brings with it a new phase of modeling of connections.’’13 The role of the surroundings is therefore fundamental here. A great deal of the development of the human brain is accomplished in the open air, in contact with the stimuli of the world, which directly influence both the development and the volume of connections. The visual system, for example, is not entirely functional at birth. The synapses connecting fibers coming from the retina to neurons in the visual cortex are not yet entirely formed. Information received from outside acti- vates the synapses and encourages maturation. In this sense, in the second phase of development one can speak of a modeling of synapses or a mechanism of synaptic plastic- ity—always tied, as we have seen, to a genetic program. \\nThe genesis of the brain, through the two phases of es- tablishing connections and their maturation under the in- fluence of the surroundings, thus makes evident a certain plasticity in the execution of the genetic program. In both cases, the brain appears at once as something that gets formed—progressively sculpted, stabilized, and divided into different regions—and as something formative: little by little, to the extent that the volume of connections grows, the identity of an individual begins to outline itself. But the more time passes, the more this ‘‘first plasticity’’ loses its determinist rigor. The sculptor gradually begins to improvise. Bit by bit, the modeling becomes that which our own activity imprints on the connections: ‘‘our brain . . . modeled by our own activity, by our interactions with the external world, by the influences we have received in the course of our education, knows our history and our trajec- tory. From this intimacy is born a profound identity be- tween the functioning of our brain and our conception of the world, an identity of views, one might say.’’14 \\nIn fact, this first type of plasticity is closely tied to the second, both because the influence of the surroundings gradually takes over from epigenetic sculpting and because it engages in a more and more precise activity. The re- strained or ‘‘closed’’ meaning of plasticity very quickly runs into its ‘‘open’’ signification: the ‘‘freedom’’ in which deter- minacy and nondeterminism cross paths in an astonishing way. Indeed, we see that cerebral morphogenesis results not in the establishment of a rigid and definitively stable struc- ture but rather in the formation of what we might call a template. This is then refined (sculpted) during develop- ment and, in a subtler but always powerful way, throughout life. The nervous activity of pre-established circuits thus takes over from apoptotic sculpting. Henceforth the envi- ronment of the brain qua organ (the modeling of connec- tions) and its external environment (synaptic modulation by influence of the surroundings) play the role of morpho- genic factors. \\nModulational Plasticity: The Brain and Its History \\nAt this point, we immediately encounter brain plasticity’s second field of action: the modification of neuronal connec- tions by means of the modulation of synaptic efficacy. Without a doubt, it is at this level that plasticity imposes itself with the greatest clarity and force in ‘‘opening’’ its meaning. In effect, there is a sort of neuronal creativity that depends on nothing but the individual’s experience, his life, and his interactions with the surroundings. This ‘‘creativ- ity’’ is not reserved solely for the human brain but is already at work in the most rudimentary nervous systems. \\nSuch a plasticity, consisting in the fashioning of inter- connections and in the modulation of synaptic efficacy, was first brought to light by the Canadian neurologist Donald Holding Hebb.15 At the end of the 1930s, various experi- mental observations led him to abandon the concept of a rigid localization of memory circuits along the lines of the model of reflex circuits described by Pavlov. According to Hebb, we must postulate the existence of ‘‘plastic synapses’’ capable of adapting their transmission efficacy. Hebb for- mulated the hypothesis of neuronal circuits capable of self- organization, that is, of modifying their connections during the activity required for perception and learning. The syn- apse is the privileged locus where nerve activity can leave a trace that can displace itself, modify itself, and transform itself through repetition of a past function.16 \\nThe capacity of synapses to modulate their efficacy and to modify the force of their interconnections under the in- fluence of experience works in a double sense. The efficacy of the synapse (its capacity to transmit signals from neuron to neuron) either rises, which is called ‘‘long-term potentia- tion’’ (LTP), or diminishes, which is ‘‘long-term depres- sion’’ (LTD). This can be verified even in an animal like the aplysia. Its central nervous system is simple, composed of eight pairs of ganglia situated around its esophagus and one large abdominal ganglion. The aplysia has a small set of ste- reotypical behaviors, among them a number of protective maneuvers, such as retracting its siphon and its gills. But the intensity of its self-defense reflex is modulated by expe- rience. Repeated innocuous stimulation of its mantle results in a diminution of the reflex (a habituation), which mani- fests as a decrease in the size of the retracting motion. This habituation is accompanied by a depression in synaptic ac- tivity correlated to the amount of neurotransmitter emitted at the level of the motor-sensory synapse.17 \\nThe phenomena of long-term depression and potentia- tion show up with much more clarity in the processes of adaptation, learning, and memory at work in birds. The black-headed titmouse, for example, stores food in caches and later retrieves it, practically infallibly. Researchers have been able to establish that the size of one of the brain re- gions (the hippocampus18) implicated in this process is greater in this bird than in others that do not stockpile their food. That is, species that practice such stockpiling have sig- nificantly larger hippocampuses than others. This change results from a growth in the number of new neurons, from a diminution in cell death (apoptosis), and from an increase in the connections between the neurons of the hippocam- pus. The hippocampus thus manifests a remarkable struc- tural plasticity.19 \\nPotentiation and depression are not just synaptic proc- esses in which one or more stimuli induce immediate acti- vations; they are also long-term modifications, capable of changing form (a change in the size of brain region, a varia- tion in the permeability of a regularly activated region) and of undoing a trace in order to remake it differently (the la- bility of the mnemonic trace). Generally, some nerve net- works increase their performance by ‘‘depressing’’ synapses involved in cognitive tasks that have led to errors in the course of motor-system education. This phenomenon shows up quite clearly in the human brain during all learn- ing processes. In the course of learning to play the piano, for example, the mechanism for depressing entry signals corresponding to incorrect movements (‘‘mistakes’’) makes possible the acquisition of the correct movements. In the case of potentiated connections, synapses enlarge their area of contact, their permeability rises, and nerve conductivity is more rapid. Inversely, a little-used or ‘‘depressed’’ synapse tends to perform less well. Neurons somehow remember stimulation. Everything happens as if there were no stabili- zation of memories except on the condition of a potential destabilization of the general landscape of memory.20 \\nLong-term potentiation is therefore structurally tied to long-term depression,21 and this tie constitutes the differ- entiating or transdifferentiating force of neuronal plasticity. By analogy with the process of becoming that stem cells un- dergo, one could claim that neuronal connections, because of their own plasticity, are always capable of changing differ- ence, receiving or losing an imprint, or transforming their program. \\nThe fact that synapses can see their efficacy reinforced or weakened as a function of experience thus allows us to as- sert that, even if all human brains resemble each other with respect to their anatomy, no two brains are identical with respect to their history. The phenomena of learning and memory show this directly. Repetition and habit play a considerable role, and this reveals that the response of a ner- vous circuit is never fixed. Plasticity thus adds the functions of artist and instructor in freedom and autonomy to its role as sculptor. In a certain sense, it is possible to assert that the synapses are the future reserves of the brain. They are not immobilized and do not constitute simple transmitters of nervous information but rather have the power to form or to reform this very information. ‘‘The efficacy of the syn- apses,’’ declares Jeannerod, ‘‘varies with respect to the flux of information traversing them: during infancy and throughout life, each one of us is subject to a unique con- figuration of influences from our external surroundings, which resonates in the form and the functioning of the brain’s networks.’’22  This allows us to put back into question the old dogma that the adult brain steadily loses its plasticity, the dogma that the brain can of course acquire new information but can know no great change in its capacity to learn, its mem- ory function, or its global structures except in the direction of decline or degeneracy. On the contrary, we see that there exists an ongoing reworking of neuronal morphology. \\nReparative Plasticity: The Brain and Its Regeneration \\nThis point leads to our treatment of plasticity’s third field of action: repair. Two distinct processes fall under the head- ing of reparative plasticity: neuronal renewal, or secondary neurogenesis, and the brain’s capacity to compensate for losses caused by lesions. \\nWhat are we to understand by ‘‘neuronal renewal’’ or ‘‘secondary neurogenesis’’? According to what we have just said, it would seem that a primary plasticity—morphogenic —is followed by a modulational plasticity that modifies synaptic efficacy but does not affect the anatomical stability of the brain, as though this plasticity somehow operated in- side a closed system. ‘‘Certain scientists,’’ declares Heather Cameron, ‘‘still cling to a very rigorous form of the hypoth- esis of a stable brain, according to which there is no ana- tomical plasticity in the adult brain, and especially not in the cortex; they hold that the functional plasticity underly- ing learning mechanisms requires only modifications in the force of the synapses, produced by a modification in the receptors or in the intercellular environment of the neuron at the molecular level.’’23 But this dogma of the stable brain is not quite right. In fact, she continues, ‘‘we know already that certain neurons in regions important to the learning process renew themselves continuously—which constitutes a relatively important anatomical modification.’’ Even if the role of stem cells in the adult brain and their localization still remain poorly known, even if it is probable that sec- ondary neurogenesis does not affect all regions of the brain, a renewal of nerve cells in adulthood exists all the same, a renewal that, in opening untapped perspectives on brain re- pair, modifies the way in which we must view the function- ing of the brain. \\nA recent study of the neocortex in primates has produced evidence of new neurons in three regions of the associative cortex: the prefrontal region, the inferior temporal region, and the posterior parietal region. ‘‘This result is particularly interesting because the associative cortex plays an important role in high-level cognitive functions, while the striate cor- tex [in which no renewal is observed] participates in the handling of information with a visual origin. This differ- ence makes one think that neurogenesis could play a key role in essentially plastic functions, while it would be point- less for low-level functions like the handling of sensory data, which functions are generally stable throughout life.’’24 \\nThe production of new neurons therefore does not sim- ply serve to replace cells that have died; it participates in modulational plasticity and, in doing so, opens the concept of plasticity slightly more, just far enough to unsettle the concept of stability. Once more: the statue is alive, the pro- gram quickens itself; right where we have so often believed we would find only mechanism, we find a complex entan- glement of different types of plasticity, which contradicts the ordinary representation of the brain as machine. Alain Prochaintz affirms: \\nOne of the major characteristics of the nervous system is, without a doubt, its plasticity. The brain cannot be considered to be a network of permanently estab- lished cables, with cerebral aging being the result of an increasing number of units in this circuit becoming disconnected from the network and going out of op- eration. Although this has not positively been demon- strated except in a few experimental models, we can assume that every day new fibers are growing, syn- apses are becoming undone, and new ones are being formed. These changes in the neuronal . . . landscape mark our capacity for adaptation, our capacity for learning and improvement, which continue until an advanced age, and in fact until death.25 \\nIn an article entitled ‘‘The Curious Partition of New Neurons,’’26 researchers assert that ‘‘in light of observations of secondary neurogenesis, it appears clear that the adaptive capacities of the nervous systems of birds and adult mam- mals are not solely the result of variations in synaptic con- nections. They are dependent on the production or the renewal of neurons in some very precise regions—regions that have the common characteristic of having functions tied to learning and/or memory. In this context, secondary neurogenesis also seems to permit a subject’s personal expe- rience routinely to leave an imprint on the core of neuronal networks, in the form of regular morphological and func- tional reworking. Adult neurogenesis, being the final mech- anism of plasticity and one strongly controlled by a subject’s personal experience and environmental interac- tions, very likely constitutes an additional mechanism of individuation—with the major difference that it is opera- tional throughout life.’’27 \\nThe idea of cellular renewal, repair, and resourcefulness as auxiliaries of synaptic plasticity brings to light the power of healing—treatment, scarring, compensation, regenera- tion, and the capacity of the brain to build natural prosthe- ses. The plastic art of the brain gives birth to a statue capable of self-repair. We know full well that the function- ing of the brain can be disturbed by numerous pathological causes, the best-known being cranial trauma, strokes, en- cephalitis, and neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s). But the nervous system always demonstrates plasticity after such handicaps or lesions, whether or not these efforts are crowned with success: the affected struc- tures or functions try to modify themselves so as to com- pensate for the new deficit or form a new and abnormal organizational schema that restores normalcy. \\nReparative plasticity obviously does not make up for every deficit; we know that certain neuronal lesions are irre- versible. But at the beginning, in the brain, there is always a more or less successful, more or less efficacious, more or less durable attempt to reorganize the affected function. Jeannerod takes as an example the phenomenon of \\nthe paralysis of the left arm provoked by a lesion on the right side of the motor region of the cortex follow- ing a stroke. At the start, all movement is impossible; the arm is immobile and flaccid. After a certain pe- riod, the muscular force returns, and elbow and wrist movements reappear. How is this possible if the neu- rons responsible for controlling these movements have been destroyed? . . . Functional neural imaging is very useful here: it shows us that during the pa- tient’s efforts to move the paralyzed arm, the left side of the motor region of the cortex, spared by the lesion, is activated. The patient, by himself or through reha- bilitation, has learned to use nerve pathways that would not be there in the normal state. This reorgani- zation of motor function testifies once more to the plasticity of brain mechanisms.28 \\nAnother example is what happens at the onset of Alzhei- mer’s disease. The encroaching amnesia is compensated for in part by a capacity to recuperate stored information. The deactivation of certain regions (the region of the hippocam- pus) is balanced by a metabolic activation of other regions (the frontal regions). Thus after certain circuits are affected, there is a modification in strategies for handling informa- tion, a modification that again attests to the functional plas- ticity of the brain.29 \\nThere are, therefore, functions for postlesional reorgani- zation. These phenomena can also be observed in certain transplants. In January 2000, a team from Edouard Harriot Hospital in Lyon performed the first human double hand transplant on Denis Chatelier, thirty-three years old, whose hands had been amputated four years earlier following an accidental explosion. The question was: Even if one man- ages to re-establish a precise anatomical continuity between the donor’s hands and the recipient’s forearms, can one at- tain the same continuity on the psychological and neuro- logical level? The Chatelier case showed that one can. His phantom pains disappeared, and the motor progress he made allows us to assert that his brain succeeded in integra- ting his transplanted hands. ‘‘When the motor cortex reor- ganizes itself, the synapses modify themselves. They change their relative influence, their ‘weight’ in the local function- ing of the network of neurons. . . . After the transplant, such a change in neuronal connections could come to re- store the representation of the hand.’’30 Yet more proof of our brain’s striking capacity for adaptation. \\nAre We Free to Be High Performing? \\nWe can see it now: there are not just one but many plasticit- ies of cerebral functioning. The interaction of these plastic modalities sketches an organization that does not at all cor- respond to traditional representations of the brain as a ma- chine without autonomy, without suppleness, without becoming—representations that today have become true ‘‘epistemological obstacles.’’ It is urgent that we affirm, against these representations, which no longer represent anything at all, that our brain is in part essentially what we do with it. Individual experience opens up, in the program itself, a dimension usually taken to be the very antithesis of the notion of a program: the historical dimension. Plastic- ity, between determinism and freedom, designates all the types of transformation deployed between the closed mean- ing of plasticity (the definitive character of form) and its open meaning (the malleability of form). It does this to such a degree that cerebral systems today appear as self- sculpted structures that, without being elastic or polymor- phic, still tolerate constant self-reworking, differences in destiny, and the fashioning of a singular identity. \\nThe question that inevitably poses itself is thus: How can we know how to respond in a plastic manner to the plastic- ity of the brain? If the brain is the biological organ deter- mined to make supple its own biological determinations, if the brain is in some way a self-cultivating organ, which cul- ture would correspond to it, which culture could no longer be a culture of biological determinism, could no longer be, in other words, a culture against nature? Which culture is the culture of neuronal liberation? Which world? Which society? \\nThe concept of plasticity has an aesthetic dimension (sculpture, malleability), just as much as an ethical one (so- licitude, treatment, help, repair, rescue) and a political one (responsibility in the double movement of the receiving and the giving of form). It is therefore inevitable that at the ho- rizon of the objective descriptions of brain plasticity stand questions concerning social life and being together. To ex- pedite matters, let us reduce these to one option: Does brain plasticity, taken as a model, allow us to think a multi- plicity of interactions in which the participants exercise transformative effects on one another through the demands of recognition, of non-domination, and of liberty? Or must we claim, on the contrary, that, between determinism and polyvalence, brain plasticity constitutes the biological justi- fication of a type of economic, political, and social organiza- tion in which all that matters is the result of action as such: efficacy, adaptability—unfailing flexibility? \\nThe Central Power in Crisis \\nThese questions, of course, concern the governing and command functions immediately attributed to the brain. It is because in each individual the brain constitutes the con- trolling authority par excellence that all the descriptions we can give of it always participate, in one way or another, in political analysis. We can thus affirm that there is no scien- tific study of the modalities of cerebral power that does not by the same token—implicitly and usually unconsciously— adopt a stance with respect to the contemporary power of the very study within which it operates. There is today an exact correlation between descriptions of brain functioning and the political understanding of commanding. \\nWhat is the main transition point between the neuronal and the political? The foregoing descriptions of brain plas- ticity allow us to respond immediately: it has to do with putting centrality back into question. The metaphor of the central organ has definitively been surpassed, even if it con- tinues to impose itself as an epistemological and ideological obstacle. This crisis of centrality rests on a delocalization and a reticular suppleness in the structures of command. In the same way that neuronal connections are supple and do not obey a centralized or even truly hierarchized system, political and economic power displays an organizational suppleness in which the center also appears to have disap- peared. The biological and the social mirror in each other this new figure of command. \\nThe End of the ‘‘Machine Brain’’ \\nThe Central Telephone Exchange and the Computer \\nThis new figure explains the fruitlessness of the well-known technological metaphors that have been used to characterize brain functioning. Essentially, these are mechanical meta- phors, which turn the brain—as they do machines—into a control center. The two most famous, today put back into question by the discovery of plasticity, are the ‘‘central tele- phone exchange brain’’ and the ‘‘computer brain.’’ The two assimilate the brain to a center and its organization to a process of centralization. \\nIn Matter and Memory, Henri Bergson develops a famous analogy between the brain and a central telephone ex- change. For Bergson, the role of the brain is limited to that of centralizing information. The brain does not produce representations; it contents itself with collecting them, sending them up the line, bringing them down the line, and circulating them: ‘‘in our opinion . . . the brain is no more than a kind of central telephonic exchange: its office is to allow communication or to delay it. It adds nothing to what it receives . . . but it really constitutes a center.’’1 Bergson seeks to determine the role the brain plays in action: like a central telephone exchange, it puts things in relation but does not intervene in the relation itself. In this way, having no power either to create or to improvise, it does nothing beyond passing on messages. Jeannerod, commenting on these propositions of Matter and Memory, explains: \\nThe brain relates nervous excitation coming from the periphery to the motor mechanism. In the case of re- flex motion, the excitation is propagated directly to the motor mechanisms of the medulla, and action is immediate. In the case of a more complex action, re- lated to a perception, it takes a detour through the sensory cells of the cerebral cortex before descending again to the medulla. What has it gained by this de- tour? Certainly not the power to transform itself into a representation, which is useless, according to Berg- son, but only the fact of being able to be connected, by the cells of the motor cortex, to the set of motor mechanisms of the medulla and thereby the power to choose its effect freely.2 \\nAs fascinating as it may be, this metaphor of the central telephone exchange is today outdated because it completely fails to capture plasticity and does not take into account synaptic and neuronal vitality.3 \\nThe cybernetic metaphor has also had its day. One of the subsections of Jeannerod’s book The Nature of Mind is entitled ‘‘The Comparison Between Brain and Computer Is Not Pertinent.’’4 This comparison dates to the fifties and reigned until the end of the eighties. It allowed research in Artificial Intelligence to make considerable progress.5 The common trait of the brain and the computer is inarguably the notion of the program: the brain then would have a central programming function. Very simply, the analogy between the cybernetic domain and the cerebral domain rests on the idea that thinking amounts to calculating, and calculating to programming. The computer and the brain would in the end both be ‘‘thinking machines,’’ that is, physico-mathematical structures endowed with the prop- erty of manipulating symbols. The discovery of the plastic- ity of brain functioning has rendered such a comparison moot. Plasticity invalidates not the analytical or explicative value of the mechanical paradigm in itself—a paradigm that is, to a certain extent, indispensable for thinking about brain function—but rather the central function habitually associated with the computer and its programs. Opposed to the rigidity, the fixity, the anonymity of the control center is the model of a suppleness that implies a certain margin of improvisation, of creation, of the aleatory. As Jeannerod says: ‘‘the activity of the nervous system can be better repre- sented as the outline of a multidimensional map than as a sequence of symbols.’’6 The representation of the center collapses into the network. \\nThe interaction of the brain with its surroundings in- stead acts as a commanding authority, whose unknown form and location disrupt the traditional geography of gov- ernment. The functional plasticity of the brain deconstructs its function as the central organ and generates the image of a fluid process, somehow present everywhere and nowhere, which places the outside and the inside in contact by devel- oping an internal principle of cooperation, assistance, and repair, and an external principle of adaptation and evolu- tion. ‘‘The brain would thus no longer be an organ that transfers the commands of the mind to the body, a kind of controller working from the top down, but rather a system that continuously proposes solutions compatible with our history and our needs.’’7 \\nGilles Deleuze, who is one of the rare philosophers to have taken an interest in neuroscientific research since the 1980s, goes so far as to talk of the brain as an ‘‘acentered system,’’ ‘‘the effect of a break with the classical image’’ that has been formed of it.8 Cerebral space is constituted by cuts, by voids, by gaps, and this prevents our taking it to be an integrative totality. In effect, neuronal tissue is discontinu- ous: ‘‘nerve circuits consist of neurons juxtaposed at the syn- apses. There is a ‘break’ between one neuron and the other.’’9 Between two neurons, there is thus a caesura, and the synapse itself is ‘‘gapped.’’ (One speaks, moreover, of ‘‘synaptic gaps.’’) Because of this, the interval or the cut plays a decisive role in cerebral organization. Nervous infor- mation must cross voids, and something aleatory thus in- troduces itself between the emission and the reception of a message, constituting the field of action of plasticity. \\nThis specific distribution of information, which contra- dicts the idea of continuity, also disrupts the picture of ver- tical organization. The ‘‘discovery of a probabilistic or semi- fortuitous cerebral space, ‘an uncertain system,’ ’’ according to Deleuze, implies the idea of a multiple, fragmentary or- ganization, an ensemble of micro-powers more than the form of a central committee. In consequence, ‘‘our lived re- lation with the brain becomes more and more fragile, less and less ‘Euclidean,’ and goes through little cerebral deaths.10 The brain becomes our problem or our illness, our passion, rather than our mastery, our solution or deci- sion.’’11 There thus exists a lived brain but, as I indicated at the start, this lived brain is not necessarily conscious. The proof of this is that the intimate feeling of cerebral fragility, constantly sustained by media images of neurodegenerative disorders, has not managed to usurp the dominant repre- sentation of a rigid centrality that is not pertinent even for describing machines. \\nI will not broach here the immense problem of the com- parison between brain and machine in general. That would be another debate and another book. I would simply like to analyze the ideological cliche ́ attached to the functioning of brains as much as to that of machines, the cliche ́ of a cen- tered and centralizing program that leaves no room for plas- ticity and entertains no relation with alterity. Why does this cliche ́, despite being undermined by scientific discoveries, have such endurance? Why does it prevent us from clearly thinking about and conceptualizing what, in effect, we live, what in many respects we make—our brains, which are, once more, our work, fashioned throughout a whole life within the intimate experience of the outside? Why doesn’t the resolutely obsolete character of cybernetic metaphors, revealed by current research on brain plasticity, leap out at us more clearly, given that we live in a period of ‘‘weak’’ Artificial Intelligence?12 And why do the same metaphors, the same cliche ́s, equally prevent us from clearly thinking and conceptualizing what we live with our computers? Why do they still force us to hold onto a low-grade antitechno- logical discourse supported by the supposed omnipotence of the program-center? \\nDaniel C. Dennett’s Consciousness Explained is one of the best books devoted to the problem of the comparison be- tween brain and computer. He vindicates the foundations of the analogy (not the identity) between the two.13 But in order to justify this foundation, he does not advance the arguments one would expect. In effect, Dennett presents the computer as itself a plastic organization, with multiple and supple levels of command. The comparison between brain and computer rests on this plasticity, which thus serves as analogon. ‘‘A computer,’’ he writes, ‘‘has a basic fixed or hard-wired architecture but with huge amounts of plasticity thanks to the memory.’’14 But how are we to char- acterize this plasticity? Like the brain, the machine Dennett describes is, against all expectation, ‘‘a virtuoso future- producer, a system that can think ahead, avoid ruts in its own activity, solve problems in advance of encountering them, and recognize entirely novel harbingers of good and ill.’’15 \\nWhat we can take away from this analysis is an approach to the machine that thinks of it not as a control center but as an organ with multiple and adaptable structures—a fu- ture-producing organization, susceptible to an always-ac- cruing functional differentiation, a machine somehow determined by the relation to alterity—a machine capable of privileging events over laws. It is not important here to determine whether such a machine exists, but simply to in- sist that this conception says out loud what we live deep inside, more precisely, that ‘‘computers are not ‘number- crunching machines,’ ’’16 something we experience daily, and that plasticity perhaps designates nothing but the eventlike dimension of the mechanical. \\nThe Adequation of Brain and World \\nNevertheless, as we’ve said, the cliche ́s of the center, of de- terministic programming, and of blind mechanics endure. We persist in thinking of the brain as a centralized, rigidi- fied, mechanical organization, and of the mechanical itself as a brain reduced to the work of calculation. Perhaps, as I have said, this is because plasticity is precisely the form of our world and because we are so immersed in it, so consti- tuted by it, that we experience it without either thinking it or being conscious of it. We do this to such an extent that we no longer see that it structures our lives and sketches a certain portrait of power. We find here the poetical and aes- thetic force that is the fundamental, organizing attribute of plasticity: its power to configure the world. Here again, De- leuze has perfectly analyzed this power by seeing in it the cinematographic function par excellence. The plasticity of the brain is the real image of the world. With a filmmaker like Alain Resnais, for example, ‘‘filmmaker of the brain,’’ ‘‘landscapes are mental states’’ and mental states are uni- verses and ‘‘cartographies,’’17 which renders them indiscern- ible and invisible as such. The films of Resnais, like those of Stanley Kubrick, display the identity of the brain and the world. We can think here of the noosphere of Je t’aime, Je t’aime, of the levels of structuration—which correspond to the forms of life of the different characters—of Mon Oncle d’Amerique, or of the giant computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey. \\nThe world configured in these films is not a centralized but a fragmented world, the faithful image of cerebral power, in which the dynamic ‘‘no longer works by totaliza- tion . . . but through continual relinked parcellings. . . . Hence the organic-cosmic bomb of Providence and the frag- mentations through transformation of sheets in Je t’aime, Je t’aime. The hero is sent back to a minute of his past, but this is perpetually relinked into variable sequences.’’18 The plasticity of time is inscribed in the brain. And we do not see it because it is a question of our time. We do not see it because it is a question of our world. We are perhaps always and necessarily blind, at first, to the political functioning and import of the brain-world (whence a certain reactivity, communally shared, to the films of Resnais). We are per- haps always and necessarily blind, at first, to our own cinema.\\n‘‘The brain is adequate to the modern world,’’ says De- leuze.19 Perhaps precisely this adequation both blinds us to and explains and justifies the effects of the naturalization of the political and social by the neuronal, on the one hand, and the political and social effects of the descriptions of neuronal functioning, on the other. We recall that the most obvious transition point between the two domains is the crisis of centrality. But if we are living this crisis daily with- out really being able to think it, if we contrive to believe in a certain efficacy of the center (brain, machine . . .) that is perhaps because power—which hasn’t been united for a long time, as Foucault endeavored to show us—has every interest in our imagining it that way. The screen that sepa- rates us from our brain is an ideological screen. By ‘‘screen’’ I mean both the cliche ́ representations that I have just ana- lyzed and the (only apparently) more ‘‘noble’’ resistances mounted against the neurosciences—more precisely against the cognitive sciences—by the majority of philosophers, psychoanalysts, and intellectuals in general. ‘‘Screen’’ also applies to the scientific descriptions themselves, which, pre- tending to lift the screen, really just reinforce it by produc- ing no critical analysis of the worldview they implicitly drive. \\nNeuronal Man and the Spirit of Capitalism \\nWhich worldview? Which world? The neo-liberal world, the world of global capitalism. The questioning of central- ity, principal transition point between the neuronal and the political, is also the principle transition point between neu- roscientific discourse and the discourse of management, be- tween the functioning of the brain and the functioning of a company. \\nRevealing that the brain is neither a rigid structure nor a centralized machine is not enough to stave off the threat of alienation. In fact, neo-liberal ideology today itself rests on a redistribution of centers and a major relaxation of hierar- chies. Domination and the crisis of centrality, in a merely seeming paradox, are perfectly matched with each other. The restructuring of capitalism (post-Fordist capitalism of the second industrial revolution) was accomplished at the price of substituting control by self-organization for plan- ning decided and overseen by a formal centralized authority within the company. In the nineties, say Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello, ‘‘creativity, reactivity, and flexibility are the new watchwords,’’ and ‘‘the bureaucratic prison ex- plodes.’’20 Or again, ‘‘the hierarchical principle is demol- ished and organizations become flexible, innovative, and highly proficient.’’21 For this new organization, the network is the master term: current capitalism obeys the principle of mobile or ‘‘lean production’’ companies, ‘‘working as net- works with a multitude of participants, organizing work in the form of teams or projects.’’22 In such companies, one pays attention only to ‘‘the number, form, and orientation of connections.’’23 \\nHow could we not note a similarity of functioning be- tween this economic organization and neuronal organiza- tion? How could we not interrogate the parallelism between the transformation of the spirit of capitalism (between the sixties and the nineties) and the modification, brought about in approximately the same period, of our view of ce- rebral structures? I have underlined the effect of the natural- ization of the social attached to neuronal functioning. Boltanski and Chiapello confirm this: ‘‘This is how the forms of capitalist production accede to representation in each epoch, by mobilizing concepts and tools that were ini- tially developed largely autonomously in the theoretical sphere or in the domain of basic scientific research. This is the case with neurology and computer science today. In the past, it was true of such notions as system, structure, tech- nostructure, energy, entropy, evolution, dynamics, and exponential growth.’’24 Like neuronal cohesion, contempo- rary corporate economic and social organization is not of a central or centralizing type but rests on a plurality of mobile and atomistic centers, deployed according to a connection- ist model. In this sense, it appears that neuronal function- ing has become the nature of the social even more than its naturalizing tool. \\nWe must insist on this natural identity in returning to the notions of network, delocalization, and adaptability, and in observing how these operate in the two domains— cerebral and socioeconomic. \\nNetworks \\nCerebral organization presupposes the connection of neu- rons in networks, which are also called ‘‘populations’’ or ‘‘assemblies.’’ In a network, there cannot be, by definition, a privileged vantage point. The network approach is neces- sarily local, never centralized or centralizing. Within the brain, writes Changeux, ‘‘the formal notion of a program finds itself replaced by an exhaustive description of proper- ties, elements, geometry, and a communication network.’’25 Thus, for example, the formation of what we call a ‘‘mental object’’—an image or concept—requires a ‘‘correlated, tran- sitory activity, both electrical and chemical, in a large popu- lation or ‘assembly’ of neurons in several specific cortical areas.’’26 There is no longer a center but rather discrete as- semblies of neurons forming mobile and momentary cen- ters on each occasion. Organizational suppleness now goes hand in hand with authority and decision. \\nWe know, moreover, that the zones of the brain serve many functions at once and can successively form part of many distinct functional networks. In other words, a given cerebral zone has no unique function: this is so for the ‘‘as- sociative’’ areas of the brain. These multifunctional regions are activated in numerous cognitive tasks and form part of a different cerebral network each time. We find ourselves faced with a complex organization that no longer proceeds in a top-down fashion from transmission to reception to retransmission of information but functions according to different, extremely complex, interpenetrating levels of reg- ulation. One therefore cannot attribute the directing func- tion to just one of them: ‘‘The notion of the localization and cartographic organization of the brain must be modu- lated by the existence of a multitude of connections be- tween brain regions as these have been identified by histology.’’27 The phenomenon of the potentiation of cir- cuits, discussed above, provides evidence that the nervous system is organized according to multiple interconnected functional spaces, always in movement and susceptible to self-modification. \\nIt is obviously with reference to this type of functioning that today’s management literature preaches work in ‘‘flex- ible, neural’’ teams,28 and can claim that the manager ‘‘is not [or is no longer] a (hierarchical) boss, but an integrator, a facilitator, an inspiration, a unifier of energies, an enhancer of life, meaning, and autonomy.’’29 The team has faith in him ‘‘inasmuch as he proves to be a connector, a vector, who does not keep the information or contacts gleaned from the network to himself but redistributes them among team members. ‘Tomorrow’s manager should make sure that in- formation is shared, that it irrigates the firm thoroughly.’ ’’30 If it is true that the ‘‘boss’’ has always been compared to the ‘‘brain,’’ we can see clearly that the neuronal manager no longer has the same style of government or command as the cerebral C.E.O. Ideally, the boss can refrain—at least in appearance—from giving orders: in principle, ‘‘the leader has no need to command,’’ because the personnel are ‘‘self- organized’’ and ‘‘self-controlling.’’31 He transmits, distrib- utes, and modifies connections by potentiating or depress- ing them according to circumstances and needs, without being identifiable with or assigned to a fixed post. Thus, ‘‘the manager is clearly the network man. His principal quality is his mobility, his ability to displace himself.’’32 The abolition of centrality goes hand in hand with the capacity to delocalize oneself. \\nDelocalization \\nWe have just seen that connections between different re- gions of the brain allow us to think a certain delocalization of cerebral activities. In effect, it seems that the localizations described by anatomists and neurologists are no longer what they were: they no longer form a rigid topography but are included in networks made and unmade as a function of the cognitive task in which the subject is engaged.33 New neuroimaging methods allow us to visualize the zones of the brain involved in the realization of cognitive tasks. Yet the ensemble of zones involved in this type of task (the classic cerebral localizations) takes the form, as we have seen, of a temporarily activated network, somehow recruited by the task to be accomplished and the cognitive context in which it is accomplished. The realization of another task would give the network a different configuration, in which some of the preceding localizations would find themselves grouped differently. The same region can contribute to the realiza- tion of different functions.34 The mental object, in turn, says Changeux, has an organization ‘‘both local and delocal- ized.’’35 The primary qualities of assemblies of neurons are their mobility and their multifunctionality. \\nBut aren’t these qualities also those expected today of the individual in the working world? Shouldn’t we become polyvalent, accepting the law of delocalization by making ourselves available, showing ourselves to be without attach- ment, ready to break old ties, to create new ones? In a com- pany, write Boltanski and Chiapello, ‘‘valued staff members are those who succeed in working with very different peo- ple, prove themselves open and flexible when it comes to switching projects, and always manage to adapt to new cir- cumstances.’’36 Today the emphasis is clearly put on poly- valence more than on craft, on the multiplication of encounters and potentially reactivizable temporary connec- tions, on belonging to diverse groups. Capitalism obvi- ously—implicitly and explicitly—refers to neuronal func- tioning as it pretends ‘‘to replace essentialist ontologies with open spaces without borders, centers, or fixed points, where entities are constituted by the relations they enter into and alter in line with the flows, transfers, exchanges, permuta- tions, and displacements that are the relevant events in this space.’’37 This happens to such a degree that anchorings in a space or a region, attachment to family or a domain of specialization, and overly rigid fidelity to self appear incom- patible with what today is called ‘‘employability.’’ One must always be leaving in order to survive, that is to say, in a certain sense, in order to remain.38 \\nAdaptability \\nWhoever says ‘‘employability’’ clearly says adaptability. ‘‘Employability’’ is a neo-management concept that indi- cates ‘‘the capacity to respond to a world in motion’’ by a supple use of abilities, which supposes we do not focus on one and only one skill, just as a cortical region does not participate in one and only one function. ‘‘Far from being attached to an occupation or clinging to a qualification, the great man proves adaptable and flexible, able to switch over from one situation to a very different one and adjust to it; and versatile, capable of changing activity or tools, depend- ing on the nature of the relationship entered into with oth- ers or with objects.’’39 It is a question of not locking oneself into a specialization while still having a specific skill to offer. \\n‘‘Employability’’ is synonymous with flexibility. We re- call that flexibility, a management watchword since the sev- enties, means above all the possibility of instantly adapting productive apparatus and labor to the evolution of demand. It thus becomes, in a single stroke, a necessary quality of both managers and employees. If I insist on how close cer- tain managerial discourses are to neuroscientific discourses, this is because it seems to me that the phenomenon called ‘‘brain plasticity’’ is in reality more often described in terms of an economy of flexibility. Indeed, the process of potenti- ation, which is the very basis of plasticity, is often presented simply as the possibility of increasing or decreasing per- formance. Very often, the brain is analyzed as personal capi- tal, constituted by a sum of abilities that each must ‘‘invest optimally,’’ like an ‘‘ability to treat one’s own person in the manner of a text that can be translated into different lan- guages.’’40 Suppleness, the ability to bend, and docility thus appear to join together in constituting a new structural norm that functions immediately to exclude. \\nSocial ‘‘Disaffiliation’’ and Nervous Depression: The New Forms of Exclusion \\nIn effect, anyone who is not flexible deserves to disappear. In The Fatigue of Being Oneself: Depression and Society, a work dedicated to nervous depression and the new psychia- try, sociologist Alain Ehrenberg shows that the frontier sep- arating psychical suffering and social suffering is thin. Depression is merely a form of what another sociologist, Robert Castel, calls ‘‘disaffiliation.’’ In both cases, it is a question of suffering from exclusion, articulated as so many illnesses of flexibility. The depressed person, like the ‘‘social failure,’’ evidently suffers from a lack of ‘‘employability’’ and adaptability. The coincidence between current psychi- atric discourse, characterized by a clear tendency toward the ‘‘biologization’’ of psychical or mental disturbance, and the political discourse of exclusion, which presents the disaffil- iated as individuals ‘‘with broken connections,’’ is striking. Before coming to the necessary distinction we must work out between a simply flexible identity and a truly plastic identity—a distinction resting on a theory of transforma- tion—we should pause a moment on the question of this suffering. About this topic psychiatrists, neurobiologists, and politicians all advise the same thing: modify the neu- ronal (the ‘‘network’’) to differently configure oneself; am- plify connections to reinstate mental and behavioral ‘‘plasticity.’’ \\n‘‘Structural and functional brain imaging,’’ we read in a medical brochure, \\nhave . . . shown that depressive episodes are accompa- nied by anatomo-functional correlates in certain brain regions, more precisely, at the level of networks in- volving the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. On this basis, it has been possible to iden- tify signs of hippocampic atrophy associated with hy- peractivity of the corticotropic axis in recurrent depressions, as well as in post-traumatic stress disor- der. These claims have led to the hypothesis of the neurotoxicity of anxious and depressive episodes. Moreover, the neurological study of cerebral struc- tures has revealed signs of neuronal, axonal, and dendritic atrophy, with diminution of synaptic con- nections and of nervous tissue.41 \\nThus depression, indeed, psychical suffering in general is associated with a diminution of neuronal connections (as if the concept of long-term depression had a literal sense). This diminution usually corresponds to an inhibition. \\nThe depressed person is indeed frequently ‘‘apathetic,’’ characterized by ‘‘holding back, stiffening, braking, and suspension of activity.’’42 Nevertheless, ‘‘mental disturbance no longer concerns a person’s difficulties; [it becomes] an illness that cuts a patient off from his aspect as agent.’’43 This redefinition of an ill person as cut off from his possible actions on the cognitive level as well as on the emotional and purposive level corresponds to the biologization or ‘‘re- biologization’’ of disturbance mentioned above. From such a perspective, therapy consists first and foremost in analyz- ing the mechanisms blocking transmission of information in the neuronal systems. Antidepressants, in their great di- versity, all seek to stimulate neurochemical transmission, with the avowed goal of ‘‘restoring and protecting the plas- tic capacities of the brain.’’44 But plasticity ought not to be confused, as we will see, with the mere capacity to act. \\nOnce again, it is not a matter of criticizing psychiatric reductionism in the name of a supposed ‘‘freedom’’ of psychism. To deny the neurological foundation of depres- sion, to deny the therapeutic power of certain molecules, would be absurd and vain. Neuropsychiatry is without question one of the most promising disciplines today, and I avidly follow the molecular adventure of psychopharma- ceuticals. It is therefore not a question of pitting the nobil- ity of ‘‘classical’’ psychoanalysis against the baseness of psychiatry, but of seeing how a certain conception of flexi- bility—paradoxically driven by the scientific analysis of neuronal plasticity—models suffering and allows the identi- fication of psychical illness and social illness. \\nToday these two types of disturbance tend to be con- flated. One must see clearly that, for all intents and pur- poses, ‘‘the workplace is the antechamber of nervous depression.’’45 The absence of centrality and hierarchy evoked above, the absence of clear and localized conflict, and the necessity of being mobile and adaptable constitute new factors of anxiety, new psychosomatic symptoms, new causes of severe neurasthenia. ‘‘In business,’’ explains Alain Ehrenberg: \\nthe (Taylorian or Fordist) disciplinary models of human resources management are on the decline, in favor of norms that encourage autonomous behavior, even for personnel at the bottom of the hierarchy. . . . Modes of regulation and domination of the workforce are now based less on mechanical obedience than on initiative: responsibility, the capacity to evolve, to form projects, motivations, flexibility, etc. . . . The model imposed on the worker is no longer that of the man-machine of repetitive labor, but that of the en- trepreneur of flexible labor.46 \\nThus a depressive is a sick person who cannot stand this conception of a ‘‘careerist’’ whose very existence is con- ceived as a business or a series of projects. \\nEhrenberg continues: \\nWhatever domain one considers (company, school, family), the rules of the world have changed. They are no longer obedience, discipline, and conformity to morals, but flexibility, change, reaction time, etc. The demand for self-mastery, affective and psychical sup- pleness, and capacities for action force each person to adapt continuously to a world without continuity, to an unstable, provisional world in flux, and to careers with ups and downs. The legibility of the social and political game is muddied. These institutional trans- formations give the impression that everyone, includ- ing the most fragile, must take up the task of choosing everything and deciding everything.47 \\nSuch a situation surely creates a certain vulnerability, a new precariousness, a new fragility. The difficulty in experienc- ing a conflict voids the psyche and in effect replaces neuro- sis with ‘‘the fatigue of being oneself.’’ \\nRobert Castel thematizes \\nthe presence, apparently more and more insistent, of individuals who virtually drift about within the social structure, and who populate interstices of society without finding any established position within it. Vague silhouettes, at the margins of labor and at the frontiers of socially consecrated forms of exchange— the long-term unemployed, inhabitants of abandoned suburbs, recipients of a national minimum income, victims of industrial downsizing, young people in search of employment who carry themselves from place to place, from menial jobs to temporary work— who are these people, where did they come from, and what will become of them?48 \\nThis vocabulary of drifting, of lack of place, of wander- ing, obviously recalls that of depression, inhibition, or anxi- ety. The phrase ‘‘social question’’ in the title of Castel’s book From Manual Workers to Wage Laborers: The Transfor- mation of the Social Question means ‘‘a concern about a soci- ety’s ability to maintain its own cohesion.’’49 Yet how could we not think that there is conjointly a psychiatric question, bearing the same sense, which testifies (and perhaps only testifies) to a worry about social cohesion? How could we not think that depressive or disaffiliated individuals repre- sent threats of turbulence, of breaks in transmission in the fluidity of the network? ‘‘In a connectionist world, where high status presupposes displacement,’’ write Boltanski and Chiapello, ‘‘the big shots derive part of their strength from the immobility of the little people, which is the source of their poverty. . . . Everyone thus lives in a state of perma- nent anxiety about being disconnected, rejected, abandoned on the spot by those who displace themselves.’’50 This anxi- ety creates precariousness, that is to say, ‘‘the increasingly drastic privation of links and the progressive emergence of an inability not only to create new links but even to main- tain existing links (separation from friends, breaking of family ties, divorce, political abstentionism).’’51 This lack of ties and this risk of being cut off appear as threats that one must contain or ward off at any cost to maintain the cohe- sion of the community. \\nHence to heal means to reintegrate, to restore flexibility. When it first appeared, Prozac was presented as a ‘‘mood raiser’’ and an ‘‘action facilitator.’’ In his book Listening to Prozac, Peter Kramer develops a critical reflection on the type of ‘‘self’’ that ‘‘today’s high-tech capitalism’’ endorses as its condition of possibility: ‘‘Confidence, flexibility, quickness, and energy . . . are at a premium.’’52 Prozac allows one to obtain these goods at a low cost, not only because this medication is not expensive, but also because it allows one to avoid the psychical cost of acquiring these values. Mood medications, or ‘‘thymoregulators,’’ thus seem to have the function of reducing vulnerability, chronic disturbance, and psychical precariousness by targeting the neuronal networks involved in initiative, stimulation, dyna- mism, and well-being. Medications should give back the appetite for mobility, the capacity to rid oneself of rigidity and of fixity in one’s identity. \\nThus it is no longer possible to distinguish rigorously on an ideological level between ‘‘popularly’’ accessible neuro- scientific studies and the literature of management— including medical management. Think, for example, of how Alzheimer’s patients are described. An Alzheimer’s pa- tient is the nemesis of connectionist society, the counter- model of flexibility. He is presented as a disaffiliated person: errant, without memory, asocial, without recourse. One ob- serves in his brain a thinning of connections, the accumula- tion of fibrils inside neurons, and the presence of senile plaques—all factors contributing to rigidification and loss of suppleness, which, paradoxically, lead to a chaotic wan- dering.53 In how rigidity prevents initiative here, one can see an obvious relation between, on the one hand, the image constructed and conveyed of such a patient and, on the other, those constructed of the homeless, illegal immi- grants, or unemployed persons about to be kicked off the dole. In fact, it is no longer possible to distinguish rigor- ously on an ideological level between those suffering a neurodegenerative disorder and those with major social handicaps. \\nAs we have observed, any vision of the brain is necessar- ily political. It is not the identity of cerebral organization and socioeconomic organization that poses a problem, but rather the unconsciousness of this identity. The persistent use of long-defunct technological models to represent the brain bars access to a true understanding of cerebral func- tion and justifies our lack of interest in it. The representa- tions/obstacles of a rigid encephalon, cut off from thought, cut off from the essential, are precisely what induce us to keep the brain away from itself, to separate it from what it is: that is, the essential thing, the biological, sensible, and critical locus of our time, through which pass, one way or another, the political evolutions and revolutions that began in the eighties and opened the twenty-first century. At bot- tom, neuronal man has not known how to speak of himself. It is time to free his speech. \\nIndeed, without this freeing, neuroscientific discourse will have the sole consequence—beyond medical ad- vances—of unwittingly producing criteria, models, and cat- egories for regulating social functioning and increasing daily the legitimation of the demand for flexibility as a global norm. To produce consciousness of the brain is not to interrupt the identity of brain and world and their mu- tual speculative relation; it is just the opposite, to emphasize them and to place scientific discovery at the service of an emancipatory political understanding. \\nOn the one hand, neuronal functioning as it is described today quite closely resembles a democracy: mutual support (reparation), freedom of choice (one somehow constructs one’s own brain), a crossing point between the public and the private (the interaction of the outside and the inside), belonging to many spheres, mobility, openness, availability, autonomy, absence of hierarchy between the network ele- ments, and equality of function. (By contrast, the models of the central telephone exchange and the computer con- tinue to evoke the old Soviet system or Brave New World.) In one sense, progress in the neurosciences has made possi- ble the political emancipation of the brain. On the other hand, the scientific description of brain plasticity produces, while taking its inspiration from, an extremely normalizing vision of democracy, in that it accords an overly central role to the absence of center, a too rigid prominence to flexibil- ity, that is to say, to docility and obedience. Producing a consciousness of the brain thus comes down to producing the conditions of possibility for a new world of questioning: Can the description of brain plasticity escape the insidious command of the New World Order? Can it introduce something like a resistance within this very order? Can plas- tic brains measure the limits of their flexibility? \\n\\n‘‘You Are Your Synapses’’ \\nMy approach to these questions may, at first glance, seem surprising. I have just brought out the most visible points of transition between the neuronal and the political—in other words, between the biological and the social. I have shown that the concept of flexibility, the transitional or transbor- der concept par excellence, also concealed this transition’s theoretical conditions of possibility. In closing, therefore, let us linger over this concept. But how? Here comes the real surprise: we will now turn to what constitutes the chief affirmation of the neurosciences in general, and of the cog- nitive sciences in particular—the certainty that there exists a perfect continuity between the neuronal and the mental. \\nThe current state of research and observation allows cog- nitive scientists to conclude that thought, knowledge, de- sires, and affects all proceed on a neuronal, that is to say, biological, basis, and that the mental images constituting the life of the mind are indeed formed in the brain. This chief affirmation, which is the basis for all ‘‘reductions’’ (in other words, the basis for assimilating the mind to a natural datum), is at once the strongest and the weakest point of neuroscientific discourse in general. It is the strongest be- cause, even if sometimes shocking, it is incontestably, what- ever we think of it, the expression of a real advance: it has enabled us to approach phenomena such as memory, per- ception, learning—even psychical and behavioral prob- lems—more and more precisely and objectively. In the most general way, it constitutes a new approach to the sub- ject by affirming the existence of a ‘‘neuronal self.’’ It is the weakest because the certainty of the continuity between the neuronal and the mental can obviously never be a strictly scientific postulate. It necessarily constitutes a philosophical or epistemological position and such positions are not al- ways clearly articulated. I will therefore attempt to question the presuppositions attached to this continuity, not to con- test it in itself but to show that its development and func- tion are precisely discontinuous—that it is, in other words, a question of a complex continuity. \\nLogically, how are we to explain what relation could exist between such a study and the political, social, and eco- nomic questions raised above? The answer is the following: interrogating the transition from the neuronal to the mental leads us to interrogate the very core of cerebral functioning, the transition from the biological to the cultural, from the strictly natural base of the mind to its historical—and thus also, necessarily, its political and social—dimension. Rein- vestigating the question of the transition from the neuronal to the political within the field of the neuronal itself should allow us, through a strategy of redoubling, to bring out the theoretical mediations, transitions, indeed, the theoretical holes likely to unsettle the very concept of continuity, and in so doing to perturb flexibility. We shall thereby be able to grasp the distinction between what is truly liberating in this new definition of self and what within it remains a sub- jugating power. This ‘‘weighing in the balance’’ will require a critical confrontation between flexibility and plasticity. \\nThe ‘‘Synaptic Self’’ or ‘‘Proto-Self’’ \\nWe will begin with the concept of the subject or ‘‘self ’’ sup- ported by contemporary neuroscientific discourse. We will intentionally not stop saying ‘‘we,’’ even when simply ask- ing the question ‘‘What should we do with our brain?’’ For who is this ‘‘we,’’ and what relation does this ‘‘we,’’ the very possibility of saying ‘‘we,’’ have to the brain? \\nFor most neurobiologists today, the brain is not a simple ‘‘organ’’ but the very possibility of linking, the fundamental organic coherence of our personality, our ‘‘we,’’ a consider- ation that tends to blur the line between the nervous system and the psyche. Prominent neurobiologists such as Antonio Damasio and Joseph LeDoux now clearly affirm this point: consciousness is nothing other than ‘‘how the owner of the movie-in-the-brain emerges within the movie,’’1 and, as a result, we need to grasp ‘‘the essence of a person in the brain.’’2 To examine this essence, we will follow the demon- strative order adopted by LeDoux in his book Synaptic Self. ‘‘In previous chapters,’’ he writes, ‘‘we’ve seen how neu- ronal circuits are assembled during development, and how these circuits are modified when we learn and remember. Now we will begin to use this basic information about cir- cuits and their plastic properties to explore broader aspects of mental function, that is, to begin to develop a neurobio- logical view of the self.’’3 \\nSo what in fact is this synaptic ‘‘self,’’ or ‘‘proto-self,’’ as Damasio chooses to call it? Why does the analysis of brain plasticity necessarily drive us to posit its existence? To what extent is it possible to determine a personal identity on the basis of neuronal configurations and so to consider that the brain is the first and most fundamental form of subjectivity? The response to all these questions seems elementary: ‘‘My notion of personality,’’ says LeDoux, ‘‘is pretty simple: your ‘self,’ the essence of who you are, reflects patterns of inter- connectivity between neurons in your brain. . . . Given the importance of synaptic transmission to brain function, it should practically be a truism to say that the self is synap- tic.’’4 Or again: ‘‘The essence of who you are is stored as synaptic interactions in and between the various subsystems of your brain. As we learn more about the synaptic mecha- nisms of memory, we learn more about the neural basis of the self.’’5 \\nThus an awareness of synaptic plasticity leads scientists to advance the thesis of a neuronal personality. The ‘‘self’’ is a synthesis of all the plastic processes at work in the brain; this permits us to hold together and unify the cartography of networks already mentioned. ‘‘The fact that plasticity does occur in so many brain systems,’’ we read in Synaptic Self, ‘‘raises . . . interesting questions. How does a person with a coherent personality—a fairly stable set of thoughts, emotions, and motivations—ever emerge? Why don’t the systems learn different things and pull our thoughts, emo- tions, and motivations in different directions? What makes them work together, rather than as an unruly mob?’’6 It is the ‘‘self,’’ incontestably, that allows for this grouping and linking. \\nThe ‘‘proto-self,’’ or ‘‘primordial self,’’ explains Da- masio, covers ‘‘the ensemble of brain devices which contin- uously and nonconsciously maintain the body within the narrow range and relative stability required for survival. These devices continually represent, nonconsciously, the state of the living body, along its many dimensions.’’7 The proto-self is thus primarily a form of organic representation of the organism itself that maintains its coherence: ‘‘as far as the brain is concerned, the organism . . . is represented by the proto-self. The key aspects of the organism . . . are . . . provided in the proto-self: the state of the internal milieu, viscera, vestibular system, and musculoskeletal frame.’’8 This base that represents itself to itself is the very condition of life. Without it there is no possible survival and no con- sciousness. Indeed, the nonconscious processes at work in the proto-self are the very conditions of consciousness: ‘‘the proto-self is the nonconscious forerunner for the levels of self which appear in our minds as the conscious protago- nists of consciousness: core self and autobiographical self.’’9 The proto-self is thus a ‘‘preconscious biological precedent’’ out of which alone can be developed the sense of self (core self, ‘‘core consciousness,’’ or ‘‘I’’) and the temporal and historical permanence of the subject (autobiographical self, ‘‘invariant aspects of an individual’s biography’’).10 \\nOne can see that the notion of biological precedence leads directly to that of the continuity between the neuronal and the mental. Indeed, core consciousness and autobio- graphical consciousness are formed from, and emerge from, the proto-self in a progressive manner, without rupture or leap. How is this continuity possible? Here is the most in- teresting and most subtle point of the analysis: through modification of the primitive or primordial representational function that is the work of the proto-self. Indeed, one must suppose that the ‘‘proto-self’’ presents itself as ‘‘a co- herent collection of neural patterns which represent the state of the organism, moment by moment, at multiple lev- els of the brain.’’11 Thus there actually is, contrary to Berg- son’s claim, a self-representation of the brain, an auto- representation of cerebral structure that coincides with the auto-representation of the organism. This internal power of representation inherent in neuronal activity constitutes the prototypical form of symbolic activity. Everything happens as if the very connectivity of the connections—their struc- ture of reference, in other words, their semiotic nature in general—represents itself, ‘‘maps’’ itself, and precisely this representational activity permits a blurring of the borders between brain and psyche.12 \\nThe brain thus informs itself about its own state to the extent that it is informed about the state of the organism, an economy of transmission assured by a play of ‘‘signals’’ that Damasio calls ‘‘impulses.’’ This elementary conversa- tion, which constitutes one of the primary activities of the nervous system, is still called ‘‘nonconscious.’’13 The ongo- ing modification of this first cerebral habitus gives rise to more and more complex, and more and more stable ‘‘maps.’’ The construction of the link to the object demands the formation of images, or ‘‘second-order maps,’’ and thereafter of signs. In detail, the stages are the following: ‘‘the nonconscious neural signaling of an individual organ- ism begets the proto-self, which permits core self and core consciousness, which allow for an autobiographical self, which permits extended consciousness. At the end of the chain, ex- tended consciousness permits conscience.’’14 From one end of the chain to the other, Damasio explains, one must assume that the brain somehow recounts its own becoming, that it elaborates it in the form of an ‘‘account.’’ \\nWithin the cerebral structure there is something like a poetic activity or a wordless recitative function: \\nThe account describes the relationship between the changing proto-self and the sensorimotor maps of the object that causes these changes. In short: As the brain forms images of an object—such as a face, a melody, a toothache, the memory of an event—and as the im- ages of the object affect the state of the organism, yet another level of brain structure creates a swift and nonverbal account of the events that are taking place in the varied brain regions activated as a consequence of the object-organism interaction. The mapping of the object-related consequences occurs in first order neural maps representing proto-self and object; the account of the causal relationship between object and organism can only be captured in second-order neural maps. Looking back, with the license of metaphor, one might say that the swift, second-order nonverbal account narrates a story: that of the organism caught in the act of representing its own changing state as it goes about representing something else.15 \\nFrom the ‘‘proto-self’’ to ‘‘conscience’’ there thus devel- ops an extensive ‘‘re-representation of the nonconscious proto- self in the process of being modified.’’16 This process corre- sponds to the translation of neuronal patterns into mental patterns. The latter (thus ‘‘images’’ and ‘‘signs’’) constitute the elementary life of the three domains of cognition, emo- tion, and motivation, the fundamental tripartite division of the mind. Damasio affirms that ‘‘the brain makes neural patterns in its nerve-cell circuitry and manages to turn these neural patterns into the explicit mental patterns which con- stitute the highest level of biological phenomenon,’’17 and which he likes to call, succinctly, images—visual images, auditory images, tactile images, and so forth, images that can convey any object, any relation, concrete or abstract, any word, and any sign. \\nThe transition from the neuronal to the mental is con- firmed by the fact that it is impossible to distinguish the two domains rigorously and absolutely. If, in effect, there is a kind of subterranean representational activity in the brain, this already signifies that neurons, through ‘‘being in connection,’’ are already available for, and already dis- posed toward, meaning. In the same way, meaning, or sym- bolic activity in general, depends strictly on neuronal connectivity. \\n‘‘Lost in Translation:’’ From the Neuronal to the Mental \\nFascinating as they may be, these analyses remain insuffi- cient on many points. Despite the apparent assurance and certitude that govern the discourse of the ‘‘adherence’’ of the mental to the neuronal, the process of the ‘‘translation’’ of the givens from one domain to the other remains ob- scure. No matter what is said about it, this ‘‘translation,’’ for all its plausibility with respect to its function, remains questionable with respect to its lawfulness: it has never managed to be truly constituted as a law, nor to acquire thereby the value of a universal. No one today is in a posi- tion to prove that all cognitive, emotional, or practical ac- tivities are the reformulated and resystematized equivalents of neuronal configurations. As LeDoux notes, ‘‘I’ll state un- ashamedly from the start that we can’t, at this point, go all the way in formulating a complete synaptic theory of personality.’’18 \\nIf there is always a mental dimension to the neuronal and a neuronal dimension to the mental, then we must suppose that this continuity is in some way itself at once neuronal and mental, biological and cultural, or, if we anticipate the ‘‘translations,’’ at once an object of observation and an in- terpretive postulate. The continuity from the neuronal to the mental, let us recall, is in essence a theoretical mixture, at once experimental and hermeneutic, as Damasio’s re- course to the metaphors of narrative and text reveals. Thus, the space and the cut that separate the neuronal from the mental, or the proto-self from different forms of conscious- ness, are comparable not to synaptic gaps, openings that permit passage without ever hindering it, but rather to the- oretical fissures that, in order to be minimized, require that scientific explanation be relayed by interpretation. \\nIn saying this, I in no way presume to contest the hy- pothesis of neuronal and mental continuity or to play the game of antireductionism. It seems important simply to in- sist that, when this theoretical fissure is not recognized as such—as in the great majority of neuroscientific dis- courses—it runs the risk of being overwhelmed by brute, na ̈ıve ideology. \\nIt is of course entirely possible to postulate that the or- ganism, ‘‘as a unit, is mapped in the organism’s brain, within structures that regulate the organism’s life and signal its internal states continuously . . . [and that] all of these neural patterns can become images.’’19 The problem re- mains that of grasping the nature of this becoming, which permits the transformation of the proto-self into a con- scious element. Certainly, as we have just seen, Damasio proposes an explication and a metaphorics of this transfor- mation. The idea of a nonconscious process of metabolic representation is extremely interesting: effectively, it lets us formulate the hypothesis of a metamorphic fluidity assuring the synthesis of the cerebral and the psychical. But the en- tire question lies in the modality of this ‘‘synthesis,’’ the conditions of possibility of this fluidity. \\nWhat, finally, is the ultimate source of this metabolism or this cerebral/mental converter? No response advanced by the neurologists is truly satisfying. Basically, ‘‘change,’’ ‘‘translation,’’ ‘‘account,’’ and ‘‘narrative’’ are too vague and, without further analysis, do not let us grasp simultane- ously the transition from one level of organization to an- other (from the neuronal to the mental), the transition from one organizational regime to another (from the self- conservation of the proto-self to the exploratory activity of consciousness), and the transition from one organizational given to another (the proto-self is a genetic given; the self that manipulates images and signs is a biological-cultural given). We do not truly know what originally makes these transitions possible: Are they biologically programmed? Are they the fruit of experience or of individual history? Are they the result of both? \\nIn making more precise his definition of the term non- conscious, Damasio declares: \\nIn fact, the list of the ‘not-known’ is astounding. Consider what it includes: (1) all the fully formed images to which we do not attend; (2) all the neural patterns that never become images; (3) all the disposi- tions that were acquired through experience, lie dor- mant, and may never become an explicit neural pattern; (4) all the quiet remodeling of such disposi- tions and all their quiet re-networking—that may never become explicitly known; and (5) all the hidden wisdom and know-how that nature embodied in in- nate, homeostatic dispositions.20 \\nIt is thus legitimate to ask why certain neuronal patterns never become images, why certain dispositions never be- come schemas. What remains mysterious (and we cannot be satisfied here by evoking ‘‘the wisdom of nature’’) is therefore the deep structure of transformation, the transi- tion from a universal self, not yet particularized, to the sin- gular self, to that which I am, that which we are. \\nNot to interpret is still to interpret. By wishing not to construct a hermeneutic schema capable of explaining, at least provisionally, the relations between the neuronal and the mental, by wishing not to recognize the necessarily meta-neurobiological dimension of that schema, one expo- ses oneself, whether one recognizes it or not, to ideological drift—for example, and above all, to that of mental Dar- winism or psychological Darwinism. \\nAt this point we encounter yet again the political, eco- nomic, and social questions developed above. According to the ‘‘logic’’ of these ‘‘Darwinian’’ positions, only those neu- ronal configurations capable of survival, thus those capable of being the ‘‘best,’’ the highest ‘‘performing,’’ would be converted into images. Only the most ‘‘useful’’ synaptic connections would be modulated or reinforced.21 There would be at the very heart of the self a selection oriented toward efficacy. Damasio affirms that ‘‘our attitudes and our choices are, in no small part, the consequence of the ‘occasions of personhood’ that organisms concoct on the fly at each instant.’’22 But it would seem that certain persons have more ‘‘occasions’’ than others, since Damasio himself speaks of qualitative differences in individuality, referring to the ‘‘personalities that appear to us as most harmonious and mature,’’23 on the basis of the number and neuronal richness of the connections that underlie them. \\nBut what could be meant by this supplement of maturity and harmony characteristic of certain ‘‘selves,’’ if not an ex- cess of power or capacity for success, a higher number of chances to occupy a dominant position? And to what or to whom, inversely, could ‘‘nonharmonious’’ or ‘‘immature’’ personalities correspond, if not, in one way or another, to the disaffiliated we evoked above? Where is the dividing line between the two? This forces us back to the problem of the ‘‘transition.’’ If we are from the start a nonconscious proto-self always ‘‘in a process of being modified,’’ how is this modification effected? Does it proceed solely by natural selection (or cultural selection, which amounts to the same thing)?24 Must we assume an original flexibility that, by adaptive selection, forms personality? Must we postulate the suppleness of a primordial self that can (or even ought to) bend to the working of the simultaneously biological and cultural barrage to which it is subjected? \\nThese questions are fundamental. Awakening a con- sciousness of the brain, as we are trying to do, means awak- ening a consciousness of the self, a consciousness of consciousness, if you will, which is also to say a comprehen- sion of the transition from the neuronal to the mental, a comprehension of cerebral change. The brain is our work and we do not know it. The brain is constituted by modifi- cations of modifications, of ‘‘re-representations,’’ and we do not know it. The brain owes its vitality to a perpetual change in plasticity (which is also to say a plasticity of change itself ) and we do not know it. In setting these points aside in order to discuss only the results, neurobiologists and cognitive scientists contribute to confirming the diffuse and highly paradoxical feeling that the brain is the locus of an absence of change and that we cannot in reality do any- thing about it, do anything with it, other than letting selec- tion have its way. But really, what’s the point of having an all-new brain if we don’t have an all-new identity, if synap- tic change changes nothing? And what do we get from all these discourses, from all these descriptions of neuronal man, from all these scientific revolutions, if not the absence of revolution in our lives, the absence of revolution in our selves? What new horizons do the new brains, the new theo- reticians of the brain, open up? \\nAbout Antonioni’s cinematic work, Deleuze declares: ‘‘Antonioni does not criticize the modern world, in whose possibility he profoundly ‘believes’: he criticizes the coexis- tence in the world of a modern brain and an exhausted body.’’25 We could say in the same way that today we live the ‘‘coexistence of a modern brain and an exhausted iden- tity.’’ All the fascinating discoveries of the neurosciences re- main a dead letter for us, never managing to destroy our old representations of the brain (for example, that of the ma- chine brain), because they are incapable of unleashing pos- sibilities, of unleashing new ways of living and—why be afraid of the word?—new ways to be happy. It must be ac- knowledged that neuronal liberation has not liberated us. Long-term potentiation and depression cannot be the first and last words on the plasticity of a self, in other words, on its modification by experience. \\nEven if it is fascinating to observe aplysias, we cannot spend our time in ecstasies over slugs. Nor in asking our- selves, as certain popularizing scientific magazines often in- vite us to do: ‘‘How does the brain activity of a mathematician differ from that of an architect?’’ ‘‘What ce- rebral regions are active when a lawyer is preparing his argu- ments?’’ ‘‘Can we teach people to activate the appropriate cerebral regions to improve their performance?’’ or even ‘‘Will it soon be possible to read thoughts?’’26 All of this is, at bottom, a matter of perfect indifference to us, and our self itself—as much as our body—is exhausted by such an absence of perspective. A sad story for a sad subject, never granted an understanding of its own transformation. \\nWe must acknowledge an enormous discrepancy be- tween the descriptive and the prescriptive scope of neuro- scientific discourses. We must acknowledge an enormous discrepancy between, on the one hand, all the promises for the future and desires for another history and another life, desires aroused by this wholly new vision of the brain, by this continent known as cerebral plasticity, and, on the other hand, the tiny political, philosophical, and cultural space in which these promises can at once be theoretically deployed and realized. Once again, it seems that the neu- ronal revolution has revolutionized nothing for us, if it is true that our new brains serve only to displace ourselves bet- ter, work better, feel better, or obey better. The synthesis of the neuronal and the psychical thus fails to live up to its task: we are neither freer, nor smarter, nor happier. ‘‘The individual today,’’ says Ehrenberg, ‘‘is neither sick nor healed. He is enrolled in multiple maintenance pro- grams.’’27 Do we want to continue to be ‘‘chronically healthy’’ in this way? \\nHow can we fail to see that the only real view of progress opened by the neurosciences is that of an improvement in the ‘‘quality of life’’ through a better treatment of illness?28 But we don’t want these half-measures, what Nietzsche would rightly call a logic of sickness, despairing, and suffer- ing. What we are lacking is life, which is to say: resistance. Resistance is what we want. Resistance to flexibility, to this ideological norm advanced consciously or otherwise by a re- ductionist discourse that models and naturalizes the neu- ronal process in order to legitimate a certain social and political functioning. \\nAnother Plasticity \\nIf we can accept the idea that personality derives from a constellation of established connections, then we can also accept that personality is reformable or re-formable. If this is so, are this reformation and this re-forming without lim- its, or do they have some capacity to resist an excess of poly- morphism? Here we rejoin the point of confrontation between flexibility and plasticity. \\nIn order to answer all the questions that I have tried to raise from the outset, it strikes me as absolutely necessary to introduce into the register of cerebral plasticity discussed in the first chapter—in addition to developmental plasticity, modulational plasticity, and reparative plasticity—a fourth type of plasticity, never as yet envisaged by neuroscientists, that would enable and qualify the formation of the singular person on the basis of the neuronal matrix. An intermediate plasticity of some kind, situated between the plasticity of the ‘‘proto-self’’ and that of the conscious self.29 Once again, I in no way seek to contradict the thesis of the transi- tion from the neuronal to the mental or to affirm the exis- tence of an assumed incommensurability between one domain and the other. I do not adopt this ‘‘antireduction- ist’’ position but rather think that a reasonable materialism should accept the necessary mediation of the idealization of self—that the position of neuronal materialism, which I adopt absolutely, should elaborate a central idea, or theory, of the transition. But this plasticity of transition, omitted from neurobiology treatises, this plasticity connecting pro- toplasticity to experiential plasticity, should constitute this theoretical bedrock, this idea or this idealization. ‘‘You are your synapses’’: I have nothing against this sentence. I sim- ply want to understand the meaning of ‘‘being’’ here. \\nFor that, we must arrive at an intermediate plasticity, a plasticity-link that is never thought of or recognized as such, allowing us to elaborate a true dialectic of the auto- constitution of the self. This is what we must discern, as did Freud in his day by analyzing the type of transformation enabling the transition from the neuronal to the psychical, the latter never being, in a certain sense, anything more than the metamorphosis of the former.30 If we do not think through this transformation or this plasticity, we dodge the most important question, which is that of freedom. If, in effect, the life of the brain is played out between program and deprogramming, between determinism and the possi- bility of changing difference, then the transition from the proto-self to the self is indeed the transition from the undif- ferentiated to the possibility of a transdifferentiation of self—the self, between receiving and giving form, being at once what one inherits and what one has created. But we cannot settle for a neutral description of the three types of plasticity discussed in the first chapter; we must also pro- pose a model of their interaction and the joint dynamics of their genesis: how modulation links up with modeling, how reparation changes its meaning with experience, and how these interactions construct a free personality or singularity. But in order to understand such a construction, we must leave the domain of pure description and agree to elaborate a theoretical petition, once again necessarily meta-neurobi- ological, as Freud wrote, feeling the need to go behind or beyond, a metapsychology. \\nThe Upsurge and Annihilation of Form \\nPlasticity is situated between two extremes: on one side, the taking on of form (sculpture, molding, fashioning of plastic material); on the other, the annihilation of form (plastique, detonation). Plasticity deploys its meaning between sculp- tural modeling and deflagration—in other words, explo- sion. Let us now examine this last meaning. Essentially, today we must think this double movement, contradictory and nonetheless indissociable, of the emergence and disap- pearance of form. At the core of the constant circulation between the neuronal, the economic, the social, and the po- litical that characterizes Western culture today, the individ- ual ought to occupy the midpoint between the taking on of form and the annihilation of form—between the possibility of occupying a territory and accepting the rules of deterrito- rialization, between the configuration of a network and its ephemeral, effaceable character. We live in an epoch in  which identity is defined no longer as a permanent essence but as a process of autoconstitution or ‘‘fashioning,’’ to re- claim the term used by Foucault, a process at whose heart a multiplicity of possible figurations unfolds. Today everyone lives multiple lives, at the same time and successively. \\nSelf-fashioning implies at once the elaboration of a form, a face, a figure, and the effacement of another form, another face, another figure, which precede them or are contempo- raneous with them. On the one hand, the coincidence be- tween formation and disappearance of form is diachronic: a past form cedes place to a new form, and one thus changes identity or ‘‘self ’’ in the course of time. On the other hand, the coincidence between formation and disappearance of form is synchronic: the threat of the explosion of form structurally inhabits every form. All current identity main- tains itself only at the cost of a struggle against its autode- struction: it is in this sense that identity is dialectical in nature. \\nWhat does this mean? The plasticity of the self, which supposes that it simultaneously receives and gives itself its own form, implies a necessary split and the search for an equilibrium between the preservation of constancy (or, ba- sically, the autobiographical self ) and the exposure of this constancy to accidents, to the outside, to otherness in gen- eral (identity, in order to endure, ought paradoxically to alter itself or accidentalize itself ). What results is a tension born of the resistance that constancy and creation mutually oppose to each other. It is thus that every form carries within itself its own contradiction. And precisely this resis- tance makes transformation possible. \\nThe auto-constitution of self obviously cannot be con- ceived as a simple adaptation to a form, to a mold, or to the received schemata of a culture. One is formed only by vir- tue of a resistance to form itself; polymorphism, open to all forms, capable of donning all masks, adopting all postures, all attitudes, engenders the undoing of identity. Rather than displaying a real tension between maintenance and evolu- tion, flexibility confounds them within a pure and simple logic of imitation and performance. It is not creative but reproductive and normative. \\nLife and Explosion: Homeostasis and Self-Generation \\nLet us return to the problem of the transition from the neu- ronal to the mental. The dialectical nature of identity is rooted in the very nature of identity, that is to say, in its biological foundation. Indeed, in adopting the thesis of a neuronal self, I would postulate that it, too—indeed, it above all—is structured by the dialectical play of the emer- gence and annihilation of form, that the historico-cultural fashioning of the self is possible only by virtue of this pri- mary and natural economy of contradiction. \\nThe transition from the neuronal to the mental supposes negation and resistance. There is no simple and limpid con- tinuity from the one to the other, but rather transformation of the one into the other out of their mutual conflict. We must suppose that mental formation draws its being or identity from the disappearance of the neuronal, born of a sort of blank space that is the highly contradictory meeting point of nature and history. Only an ontological explosion could permit the transition from one order to another, from one organization to another, from one given to another. The neuronal and the mental resist each other and them- selves, and it is because of this that they can be linked to one another, precisely because—contra Damasio—they do not speak the same language. \\nOne of the great merits of Bergson is to have shown that every vital motion is plastic, which is to say that it proceeds from a simultaneous explosion and creation. Only in mak- ing explosives does life give shape to its own freedom, that is, turn away from pure genetic determinism. Take, for ex- ample, this passage, from Spiritual Energy: \\nWhen we consider the mechanism of voluntary move- ment in particular, the functioning of the nervous sys- tem in general, and in fact life itself in what is essential to it, we are led to the conclusion that the invariable contrivance of consciousness, from its most humble origin in elementary living forms, is to convert physi- cal determinism to its own ends, or rather to elude the law of the conservation of energy while obtaining from matter a fabrication of explosives, ever intenser and more utilizable. It will then require an almost negligible action, such as the slight pressure of the finger on the hair-trigger of a pistol, in order to liber- ate at the required moment, in the direction chosen, as great an amount as possible of accumulated energy. . . . To make and utilize explosions of this kind seems to be the unvarying and essential preoccu- pation of life, from its first apparition in protoplasmic masses, deformable at will, to its complete expansion in organisms capable of free actions.31 \\nThis formative effect of explosions and this formative ac- tion of the explosive correspond to the transformation of one motor regime into another, of one device into another, a transformation necessitating a rupture, the violence of a gap that interrupts all continuity.32 Such are the law and the adventure of energy. It is thus that one must think the transition from the neuronal to the mental, on the model of the transition from the action of storing glycogen in the muscles to the voluntary action effected through these mus- cles. Energetic explosion is the idea of nature. In passing from one motor to the other, from one energetic device to the other, force simultaneously loses itself and forms itself differently, just as the metamorphic crisis frees a butterfly from its chrysalis. The sculpture of the self is born from the deflagration of an original biological matrix, which does not mean that this matrix is disowned or forgotten but that it cancels itself. \\nDespite the explosive resonance of the meanings of plas- ticity, this vision of things obviously does not correspond to a terrorist conception of the constitution of identity. The explosions in question are clearly understood as energetic discharges, creative bursts that progressively transform na- ture into freedom. To insist on explosive surges is to say that we are not flexible in the sense that all change of identity is a critical test, which leaves some traces, effaces others, resists its own test, and tolerates no polymorphism. Paradoxically, if we were flexible, in other words, if we didn’t explode at each transition, if we didn’t destroy ourselves a bit, we could not live. Identity resists its own occurrence to the very extent that it forms it. \\nIn the central nervous system, as we have seen, the for- mative contradiction—formation/explosion—proceeds from a more original contradiction: that between the mainte- nance of the system, or ‘‘homeostasis,’’ and the ability to change the system, or ‘‘self-generation.’’ The nervous sys- tem, like any system, is self-regulated, self-organized, which means that it expends considerable energy in assuring its maintenance. Basically, in order to preserve itself from de- struction, it must keep itself in the same state. Thus it con- tinuously generates and specifies its own organization. ‘‘Homeostasis,’’ Damasio explains, ‘‘refers to the coordinated and largely automated physiological reactions required to maintain steady internal states in a living organism.’’33 But every event coming from outside necessarily comes to affect homeostasis and calls upon ‘‘another level of cerebral struc- ture,’’ charged with transforming maintenance into a cre- ative ability. In this way, as we have seen, ‘‘a face, a melody, a toothache, the memory of an event,’’ demand a first trans- formation, or account, within the ‘‘neural maps,’’ which in turn must be transformed into images or ‘‘mental maps.’’ As Jeannerod says: \\nthe biological function of intentional action ought . . . to be investigated, not as maintaining a constancy, but rather as generating new properties. . . . [This re- search results in] a reversal of the concept of the rela- tion between organism and environment: a self- regulated structure can only submit to the influence of the environment, while only a structure capable of self-generated activity could impose its own organiza- tion. Intentional movement thus becomes the means by which the organism and the environment recipro- cally interact, and by means of which the subject con- structs its own representation of the real.34 \\nBut this transition from ‘‘homeostasis’’ to ‘‘self-generation’’ is not made without rupture or gap. \\nThe plasticity that situates subjectivity between mainte- nance and construction or production of newness is not smooth. The ‘‘chain’’ that leads from elementary life to the autonomy of a free self, capable not only of integrating the disturbances arriving from the exterior without dissolving itself but also of creating itself out of them, of making its own history, is a movement full of turbulence. Homeostatic energy and self-generating energy are obviously not of the same kind. From this perspective, if the brain is really ‘‘al- ways caught up in the act of representing to itself its own change,’’ one might suppose, at the very core of the undeni- able complicity that ties the cerebral to the psychical and the mental, a series of leaps or gaps. \\nReasoned Resilience \\nThe concept of ‘‘resilience,’’ taken up and reworked by Boris Cyrulnik, confirms this proposition. Resilience is in- deed a logic of self-formation starting from the annihilation of form.35 It appears as a psychical process of construc- tion, or rather of reconstruction and self-reconfiguration, developed simultaneously against and with the threat of de- struction. In studying the cases of certain ‘‘problem chil- dren’’—children held back, mistreated, sick—Cyrulnik reports that some of them developed processes of resilience, possibilities for a becoming on the basis of the effacement of every future, for a transformation of the trace or mark, and for a historical transdifferentiation. It is as if, in order to return to themselves after the destructive trials they had suf- fered, these children had to create their own constancy, to self-generate their homeostasis. \\nBut of course these counter-generations themselves nec- essarily occur through neuronal reconfigurations and, in consequence, through a becoming-mental of these recon- figurations. Far from obeying a simply continuous move- ment, these reconfigurations and this becoming are made up of ruptures and resistance. The two energies ceaselessly collide within a resilient person. If these individuals were simply ‘‘flexible’’—that is to say, if the two energies did not collide with one another—they would be not resilient but conciliatory, that is to say, passive. But these individuals are, on the contrary, capable of changing difference. Writing of Romanian orphans who made it out of the traumatic hell of the infamous institutions of the Ceaucescu era, Cyrulnik declares, ‘‘the traces left in the brain by early lack of affect . . . and social representations . . . confined the Romanian orphans to lower social levels. But orphans whose brain scans showed an inflation of the ventricles and the cortices when they were placed with host families tell us: ‘cerebral tracesarereparable.’’’36 Tracescanchangetheirmeaning. \\nThese extreme examples concern us all. We are right to assert that the formation of each identity is a kind of resil- ience, in other words, a kind of contradictory construction, a synthesis of memory and forgetting, of constitution and effacement of forms. In excluding all negativity from their discourse, in chasing away every conflictual consideration on the transition from the neuronal to the mental, certain neuroscientists cannot, most of the time, escape the con- fines of a well-meaning conception of successful personal- ity, ‘‘harmonious and mature.’’ But we have no use for harmony and maturity if they only serve to make us ‘‘scrap- pers’’ or ‘‘prodigal elders.’’ Creating resistance to neuronal ideology is what our brain wants, and what we want for it. \\nConclusion: Toward a Biological Alter-globalism \\nThe problem of a dialectic of identity—between fashioning and destruction—poses itself all the more pointedly as global capitalism, currently the only known type of global- ization, offers us the untenable spectacle of a simultaneity of terrorism (daily detonations—in Israel, Iraq, Indonesia, Pakistan . . .) and of fixity and rigidity (for example, Ameri- can hegemony and its violent rigorism). It is as though we had before our eyes a sort of caricature of the philosophical problem of self-constitution, between dissolution and im- pression of form. Fashioning an identity in such a world has no meaning except as constructing of countermodel to this caricature, as opposed simply to replicating it. Not to replicate the caricature of the world: this is what we should do with our brain. To refuse to be flexible individuals who combine a permanent control of the self with a capacity to self-modify at the whim of fluxes, transfers, and exchanges, for fear of explosion. \\nTo cancel the fluxes, to lower our self-controlling guard, to accept exploding from time to time: this is what we should do with our brain. It is time to remember that some explosions are not in fact terrorist—explosions of rage, for example. Perhaps we ought to relearn how to enrage our- selves, to explode against a certain culture of docility, of amenity, of the effacement of all conflict even as we live in a state of permanent war. It is not because the struggle has changed form, it is not because it is no longer really possible to fight a boss, owner, or father that there is no struggle to wage against exploitation. To ask ‘‘What should we do with our brain?’’ is above all to visualize the possibility of saying no to an afflicting economic, political, and mediatic culture that celebrates only the triumph of flexibility, blessing obe- dient individuals who have no greater merit than that of knowing how to bow their heads with a smile. \\nOne can legitimately suppose, with Damasio, that a po- etic activity is at work within the brain. But the brain doesn’t tell (itself ) just any story. There is a cerebral con- flictuality, there is a tension between the neuronal and the mental, there is always the possibility that one or another trace will not convert into an image, that this or that open- ing will not be made, that this or that neuronal arrange- ment will not rise to the level of consciousness. The story is complex. We must consider that in a certain sense the brain does not obey itself, that it manufactures events, that there can be an excess in the system, an explosive part that, with- out being pathological, refuses to obey. We have seen that plasticity allows us to combine the thought of a sculpture of the self with that of transdifferentiation. To exist is to be able to change difference while respecting the difference of change: the difference between continuous change, without limits, without adventure, without negativity, and a forma- tive change that tells an effective story and proceeds by rup- tures, conflicts, dilemmas. I did not choose at random the example of stem cells above. What is fascinating about stem cells is that they bring together the origin, as their name indicates, and the future, the capacity for self re-form. Is this not the best possible definition of plasticity: the relation that an individual entertains with what, on the one hand, attaches him originally to himself, to his proper form, and with what, on the other hand, allows him to launch himself into the void of all identity, to abandon all rigid and fixed determination? \\nWe have examined the question of the convertibility of neuronal patterns into mental images and, in consequence, of the genesis of the self starting from the ‘‘proto-self.’’ We have shown that this genesis supposes that one could ac- count simultaneously for the transition from one level of organization to another, for the transition from one regime of organization to another, and, finally, for the transition from one organizational given to another. In a word, that one could understand and explain the transformation of a pure biological given into a cultural and historical thing: a free psychical consciousness or identity. We have shown that, by proposing no theory or interpretation of this trans- formation or this transition—which cannot simply be the result of observation or of objective description— neuroscientific discourse in general exposes itself to ideolog- ical risk and offers nothing new to mankind, while plasticity, far from producing a mirror image of the world, is the form of another possible world. To produce a con- sciousness of the brain thus demands that we defend a bio- logical alter-globalism. \\nThis biological alter-globalism is clearly dialectical, as I have said. It demands that we renew the dialogue, in one way or another, with thinkers like Hegel, who is the first philosopher to have made the word plasticity into a concept, and who developed a theory of the relations between nature and mind that is conflictual and contradictory in its es- sence. Rereading his Philosophy of Nature could teach us much about the transition from the biological to the spiri- tual, about the way the mind is really already a ‘‘self [Selbst],’’ a ‘‘spirit-nature’’ at whose core ‘‘differences are one and all physical and psychical.’’1 \\nOf course, although Hegel could not yet express himself in the idiom of the ‘‘neuronal’’ and the ‘‘mental,’’ his con- stant preoccupation was the transformation of the mind’s natural existence (the brain, which he still calls the ‘‘natural soul’’) into its historical and speculative being. But this transformation is the dialectic itself. If there can be a transi- tion from nature to thought, this is because the nature of thought contradicts itself. Thus the transition from a purely biological entity to a mental entity takes place in the strug- gle of the one against the other, producing the truth of their relation. Thought is therefore nothing but nature, but a ne- gated nature, marked by its own difference from itself. The world is not the calm prolonging of the biological. The mental is not the wise appendix of the neuronal. And the brain is not the natural ideal of globalized economic, politi- cal, and social organization; it is the locus of an organic ten- sion that is the basis of our history and our critical activity. \\nThe elaboration of dialectical thinking about the brain also allows us to escape the strict alternative between reduc- tionism and antireductionism, the theoretical trap within which philosophy too often confines itself. On one side —that of the cognitive sciences, in particular—we find massive affirmation of the possibility of an absolute natural- ization of cognition and mental processes. On the other, we find the affirmation of the perfectly transcendental charac- ter of thought, irreducible to biological determinations. The dialogue between Changeux and Ricoeur in What Makes Us Think? is a good example of this pair of alterna- tives. According to Ricoeur, neither the knowledge we ac- cumulate about brain functioning nor even our certainty that our mental states are conditioned by neuronal organi- zation teaches us the slightest thing about either ourselves or the way we think.2 Such a position is clearly untenable. It is not pertinent to think of our neuronal apparatus as a simple physiological substrate of thought. Conversely, nei- ther is it defensible to advocate an absolute transparency of the neuronal in the mental, an easy back-and-forth from the one to the other. A reasonable materialism, in my view, would posit that the natural contradicts itself and that thought is the fruit of this contradiction. One pertinent way of envisaging the ‘‘mind-body problem’’ consists in taking into account the dialectical tension that at once binds and opposes naturalness and intentionality, and in taking an interest in them as inhabiting the living core of a complex reality. Plasticity, rethought philosophically, could be the name of this entre-deux. \\nBy sketching an ideological critique of the fundamental concepts of the neurosciences, I have tried to steer the de- bate toward a terrain different from that of the tired alterna- tive between reductionism and antireductionism. As it happens, this also involves an ideological critique of plastic- ity. Indeed, so long as we do not grasp the political, eco- nomic, social, and cultural implications of the knowledge of cerebral plasticity available today, we cannot do anything with it. \\nBetween the upsurge and the explosion of form, subjec- tivity issues the plastic challenge. I have tried to position us at the heart of this challenge, while inviting readers to do what they undoubtedly have never done: construct and en- tertain a relation with their brain as the image of a world to come. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes \\nIntroduction: Plasticity and Flexibility—For a Consciousness of the Brain \\n1.

This description is a simplified summary of the remark- ably precise description given by Marc Jeannerod in his Le cerveau intime (Paris: Odile Jacob, 2002), 47. The axon, which is much longer than the dendrites, is in a certain sense the telegraphic line that transmits messages from one neuron to another, or to the muscle or gland that it serves. The axon and the membrane that surrounds it form the nervous fiber. Each neuron produces elec- trical signals that are propagated along the axon. The transmis- sion of the signals of one neuron to another across the synapse is generally realized by a chemical substance, the neuromediator. \\n15. Jeannerod, Le cerveau intime, 63.\\u202816.

This is why the group of synthetic materials that can be molded or modeled (bakelite, cellulose, nylon, polyamide, polyes- ter, resin, silicone, etc.) and cannot regain their initial state after being fabricated are called ‘‘plastics.’’ Many of them are rigid fol- lowing formation and cooling. \\n2. See Ali Turhan, ‘‘Des cellules souches adultes greffe ́es sont reprogrammables,’’ La Recherche 365 (June 2003): 18, entry ‘‘Plasticite ́.’’ \\n3. Brain stem cells, for example, necessarily differentiate themselves into one or another type of cell present in the brain: neurons or glial cells. There is a certain amount of room for ma- neuvering in differentiation, which is exactly what is meant by multipotence, but it remains limited. Multipotent stem cells pro- duce only a restricted number of cellular types. \\n4. ‘‘Multipotence’’ and ‘‘pluripotence’’ characterize adult stem cells, which are to be distinguished from embryonic stem cells. The latter are called ‘‘totipotent’’ to the extent that they can develop into practically the entire set of two hundred known types of cells that form a large range of tissues and organs, such as the heart, the pancreas, and the nervous system. Embryonic stem cells are therefore capable of giving birth to a complete indi- vidual. There would be much to say on the topic of stem cells, as much about their functioning and the astounding possibilities of autologous grafts they seem to promise (grafts of the organs of patients themselves, regeneration of the individual by himself, in a sense) as about the philosophical analysis of the concepts of dif- ference, reparation, transformation, remodeling of the trace or of the path. But that would be another debate. I bring in stem cells here for only two reasons: to furnish a paradigm of the ‘‘open’’ meaning of plasticity and to allow us to envisage the role of (adult) secondary neurogenesis in the modulation of synaptic efficacy. \\n5.

More and more specialists [after the analyses of Searle] devote themselves to the project of ‘weak AI,’ as opposed to the ‘strong AI’ of the early years. The project of strong AI was to discover and reconstruct the way in which man thought, and then to surpass it. The project of ‘weak AI’ is more modest. It consists in simulating, through engineering, those human behav- iors ‘generally regarded as intelligent,’ without worrying about whether or not humans perform these behaviors in the same way. It is preferable today to speak of software as an ‘aid’ to creation or to decision making, rather than of machines that will replace the human’’ (Jean-Franc ̧ois Dortier, ‘‘Espoirs et re ́alite ́s de l’Intel- ligence Artificielle,’’ in Le cerveau et la pens ́ee: La r ́evolution des sciences cognitives, ed. Jean-Franc ̧ois Dortier [Paris: Sciences Hu- maines Editions, 1999], 115). \\n13. ‘‘The level of description and explication we need is analo- gous to (but not identical to) one of the ‘software levels’ of de- scription for computers: what we need to understand is how \\n\\nhuman consciousness can be realized in the operation of a virtual machine’’ (Daniel C. Dennett, Consciousness Explained [Boston: Little, Brown, 1991], 210). The concept of a ‘‘virtual machine’’ is borrowed from Alan Turing. \\n14. Ibid., 211.\\u202815. Ibid., 188.\\u202816.

We can also think of sclerotic plaque, the adjective sclerotic (‘‘fixed, no longer evolving’’) being the exact contrary to the ad- jective plastic. \\n3. ‘‘You Are Your Synapses’’ \\nnote: The phrase that forms my chapter title comes from the American neurologist Joseph LeDoux, in his book Synaptic Self \\n(New York: Viking, 2002): ‘‘The central message of this book is ‘You are your synapses’’’ (ix). This book is currently one of the most complete, most clear, and most interesting on the topic of cerebral functioning. \\n1. Antonio R.

The psychoanalyst Andre ́ Green has further remarked, in \\nhis book La causalit ́e psychique: Entre nature et culture (Paris: Odile Jacob, 1995), that ‘‘the presence of the concept of represen- tation is almost synonymous with that of psychism’’ (314). \\n13. In the course of fascinating clinical analyses, Damasio shows that ‘‘the brain knows more than the conscious mind re- veals,’’ as is witnessed by certain illnesses attending serious mem- ory lesions, in which the ‘‘proto-self’’ remains intact. See Damasio, The Feeling of What Happens, 42ff. One can therefore conclude that ‘‘the power to make neural patterns . . . is preserved even when consciousness is no longer being made’’ (166). \\n14.

Cf.theproposalofJosephLeDouxinSynapticSelf:‘‘itcan also improve quality of life, as when it uncovers new ways of treating neurological or psychiatric disorders’’ (3). Or again: ‘‘A key question you may be asking yourself is whether all this hard- core neuroscience has, in fact, any practical application. In other words, might it be possible to use this kind of work to help im- prove normal memory and, ever more important, to rescue or prevent age-related memory loss?’’ (172). \\n29. The proto-self is plastic to the extent that, as Damasio says, it ‘‘does not occur in one place only, and it emerges dynami- cally and continuously out of multifarious interacting signals that span varied orders of the nervous system’’ (The Feeling of What Happens, 154). \\n30. Cf. Sigmund Freud, ‘‘Project for a Scientific Psychology’’ (1950 [1895]), in The Standard Edition of the Complete Psycholog- ical Works of Sigmund Freud, vol. 1, 1886–1899: Pre-Psycho- Analytic Publications and Unpublished Drafts, trans.

These energetic ruptures, as I have noted above, can also be seen at the most rudimentary level of the constitution of neu- ronal configurations, which requires the conversion of electrical signals into chemical signals and then back again to electrical sig- nals. See LeDoux, Synaptic Self: ‘‘The full sequence of communi- cation between neurons is thus usually electrical-chemical- electrical: electrical signals coming down axons get converted into chemical messages that help trigger electrical signals in the next cell. . . . As hard as it may be to imagine, electrochemical conver- sations between neurons make possible all of the wondrous (and sometimes dreadful) accomplishments of human minds. Your very understanding that the brain works this way is itself an elec- trochemical event’’ (47–48). \\n33. Damasio, The Feeling of What Happens, 39. \\n34.

On the topic of self-generation, see also Changeux, Neuronal Man: ‘‘Moreover, the human brain can develop strate- gies on its own. It anticipates coming events and elaborates its own programs. This capacity for self-organization is one of the most remarkable features of the human cerebral machine, and its supreme product is thought’’ (127). \\n35. The concept of ‘‘resilience’’ comes from material physics. ‘‘Resilient’’ means: ‘‘what resists impacts (more or less), what is characterized by a greater or lesser resilience.’’ ‘‘Resilience’’: ‘‘rela- tion between kinetic energy absorbed to cause a break in a metal to the surface of a broken section. Resilience (in kg per cm2) char- acterizes resistance to shock or impact.’’ \\n36.
