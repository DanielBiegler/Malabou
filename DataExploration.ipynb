Anxiety arises from various uncertainties that themselves can become sources of tangible disturbances exclusively for a being whose relations with itself (via intrasubjective self-objectification) and others (via inter-or subjective objectification) are routed through and modulated by ensembles of sociosymbolic configurations (i.e., \"discourses\"). Thanks to discourses and everything they bring with them, the subject \"captured\" by the signifier can come anxiously to ask what it is, as an object (especially an object of desire), for both others and itself; and, also thanks to immersion in the worlds of signifiers, such inquiring subjectivity never will alight upon definitive, final answers to its questions granting unshakeable certainty.l2l If anxiety is not only the only affect for \\npsychoanalysis but also the sole affect that doesn\\'t deceive, then all other affects (as emotions and feelings) can become causes for anxiety (as an affect proper) insofar as their deceptiveness, a deceptiveness engendered by their sociosymbolic mediation, invariably allows for casting them into doubt. As a sociosymbolic being (i.e., a parletre), one always can wonder warily, in a gesture of self-objectification, whether one honestly feels what one seemingly feels (in addition to whether others honestly feel what they indicate they feel). What could be more anxiety-inducing than feeling that one cannot trust one\\'s feelings, that one\\'s heart and soul might tell half-truths or utter falsehoods? To borrow the title of one of Laplanche\\'s books (La revolution enne inachevee), there is another \"unfinished\" aspect to the Copernican tion of psychoanalysis. As I\\'ve observed already (in chapter 8), Lacan, apropos Freud\\'s references to Copernicus, emphasizes the analytic dissolution of the illusion of knowledge\\'s inherent reflexivity that is transparent to itself; the (subject of the) unconscious subverts the notion of the self-conscious subject that supposedly, when it knows, necessarily knows that it knows. In the nian account, what remains unfinished in the Freudian Copernican revolution is the thinking-through of the full extent of the subversion of knowing tivity brought about by the psychoanalytic discovery of the unconscious as a knowledge that doesn\\'t know itself, a subversion partially obfuscated by Freud\\'s manner of interpreting his own invocation of Copernicus. (As explained viously, the pain of the blow to humanity\\'s self-image by the earth\\'s celestial decentering is mitigated and compensated for by narcissistic pride at having achieved knowledge of this decentering.) Along these lines, Lacan positions himself with respect to Freud as extending to their consequent logical ends tain crucial revolutionary trajectories that, although not followed through to I48 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

Lacan\\'s \"return to Freud\" could be depicted as an analytic-dialectical retrieval and deployment of the \"unknown knowns\" of the Freudian oeuvre (as Heidegger would phrase it, Lacan \"thinks the unthought\" of Freud). Whereas Lacan\\'s finishing of unfinished Freudian business generally focuses on thinking and knowing, with the thinking that doesn\\'t think that it thinks and the knowing that doesn\\'t know that it knows both being dynamics and structures of a fundamentally mal-linguistic-representational nature, my finishing of unfinished Lacanian business focuses on feeling as being not transparent to itself: Additionally, unlike the many critical readings of Lacan that see nothing in his teachings doing real justice to things not of a tational nature, I acknowledge that, although underemphasized and in need of further elaboration, a number of resources indeed are to be found in the Lacanian corpus for the development of a richer, more subtle metapsychology of affective life that is able to be interfaced productively with the findings of the contemporary neuroscience of the emotional brain. Even though Lacan repeatedly denies the existence of unconscious affects, considering the very phrase \"unconscious affects\" to be self-contradictory (as Freud too sometimes does), his scattered reflections on affects nonetheless hint that subjects can be \"strangers to themselves\" at the level of feeling as well as at the levels (not lated to feeling) of thinking and knowing. But, a \"return to Lacan\" modeled on Lacan\\'s return to Freud is required if these resources and hints are to be extracted and extrapolated in new directions that are neither simply Lacanian nor non-Lacanian. FROM SIGNIFIERS TO JOUIS-SENS Ł 149 ',\n",
       " '12. EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN FROM PSYCHOANALYSIS TO THE NEUROSCIENCES Among those readers of Lacan not inclined immediately to denounce his version of psychoanalysis as entirely devoid of any serious and sustained treatment of affective life-Lacanian psychoanalysis is all too frequently caricatured as a disembodied, formalist structuralism ing everything apart from static symbolic-linguistic systems-much attention has been paid to his tenth seminar. As noted, Lacan himself appeals to this particular seminar, with its focus on anxiety, as exculpatory evidence against accusations that he mishandles or ignores affects (accusations coming from a number of quarters: phenomenologies, poststructuralisms, isms, feminisms, non-Lacanian psychoanalytic orientations, and so on). ous exegetes sympathetic to Lacan, taking their lead from this appeal, attempt to derive a broader Lacanian metapsychology of affect from his discussions of anxiety in 1962-1963. But, one already might ask at this point: given the undeniable existence of numerous phenomena that are identifiable as \"affective;\\' how can a mere academic-year-out-of-twenty-seven examination of anxiety alone be presented as an adequately thorough psychoanalytic theorization of affects? tively anticipating one likely Lacanian response among others to this question, one might pose another query that seems appropriate: what justifies asserting that anxiety is the single, sole affect recognized as such by psychoanalysis, when so many other affects appear to be important and relevant in both clinical and ',\n",
       " 'pre-cisc sort many consequences, estrangement from one\\'s emotions and feelings as dent, self-transparent conscious experiences-in other words, as a parihre, one is deprived of the guarantee of certainty that, when one feels a feeling, one feels that one feels this feeling as such-then anxiety is the uniquely human affect. Why? Only human beings become subjects qua speaking beings ($); and, one of the results of such subjectification is, by virtue of the mediation of signifiers, a loss of any (pre )supposed immediacy at the level of affective experience. The subject\\'s ensuing uncertainties about its emotions and feelings, uncertainties deliberately aggravated and intensified in analysands by the analytic process, generate any number of sensations that can span the negative sensational spectrum, ranging from subtle, low-burn discomfort to acute, consuming angst, from being vaguely ill at ease to being frantic with panic (the latter state sometimes precipitating rash behaviors of the sort referred to by all analytic orientations as instances of \"acting-out\").! Every point along this range arguably involves anxiety, itself arguably distinct from any similar states of sensation (such as fear) apparently common to both humans and animals. Thus, on this interpretation, Lacan isn\\'t saying that anxiety is the only emotion or feeling of interest and pertinence to psychoanalysis. Rather, his partially outlined metapsychology of affective life proposes a tacit tinction between, on the one hand, affect and, on the other hand, emotion and feeling (one ought to recall the earlier unearthing and extensions of the Affikt-Gefohi-Empjindung triad buried in Freud\\'s original German texts and, somewhat surprisingly, passed over without remark by Lacan). Hence, less emotions and feelings could be taken into account by a Lacanian analysis. But, with respect to these passions and sentiments, if analytic attention should be paid principally to those moments when doubts of various sorts can and do arise regarding conscious emotions and feelings, then anxiety, as the affective accompaniment of such doubts, is indeed, as Lacan contends, the \"central\" and \"fundamental\" affect, at least as far as analyses of the unconscious dimensions of speaking beings qua split subjects of signifiers are concerned. However, to be perfectly exact before proceeding further, the Lacan of the tenth seminar doesn\\'t claim, as these previous articulations are at risk of gesting, that doubts (as intellectual causes) give rise to anxiety (as an affective effect). the contrary: one of Lac an\\'s theses on anxiety, stated during the year of ie Seminaire devoted to it, is that \"anxiety is the cause of doubt.\"2 ety is a \"pre-sentiment;\\' \"that which is before the birth of a sentiment;\\'3 namely, EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł lSI ',\n",
       " 'a vague premonition of the bursting-forth of new, unexpected affective or libidinal intensities indicative of that which has been unconscious. These ments are made with reference to phenomena familiar in the clinical treatment of obsessional neurosis: When anxiety arises in obsessionals-and, for Lacan, this agitating presentiment doesn\\'t deceive insofar as it can be trusted as a nal that objects closely associated with unconscious desires are lurking where in the contextual vicinity-they try to fend it off, tamp it down, and fool themselves about it. Obsessional neurotics attempt this mainly through lectualizations and rationalizations taking the form of a proliferation of tant, tentative self-interpretations creating feelings of uncertainty (Le., doubt) about feelings. How they feel is thereby buried in a hodgepodge haystack of conflicting, incompatible speculations. As Lacan puts it, \"Doubt ... is made for nothing else but combating anxiety, and this precisely by its lures.\"4 When this type of neurotic anxiety surfaces as an advance indication that against emotions and desires are threatening to irrupt into the scene of sciousness, a verbal swarm of confusing pseudoexplanations is conjured up to create deceptions allowing for skepticism as to whether any affective bance really is occurring. This skepticism struggles to sustain the illusion that nothing deviating from the narrow parameters of what the obsessional deems normal and manageable actually is in danger of transpiring. So, do Lacan\\'s stipulations in 1962 to the effect that affective anxiety is the cause of intellectual doubt, as glossed in the previous paragraph, invalidate ceding discussions here in which it\\'s hypothesized that the doubt-anxiety tion can operate in the opposite causal direction too? The answer is a definite \"No!\" for several reasons. First of all, at a very basic and broad level, one might simply (and not without justification) disagree with Lacan about the dynamics of interaction between the affective and the intellectual, dynamics he tends not to delineate in a sufficiently dialectical fashion. The approach adopted by me in this project is most certainly not one governed by a mindless, rigid tion that Lacan is infallible. Second, whether Lacan\\'s indications regarding the role of doubt specifically in obsessional neurotic defenses against anxiety generally apply across the board to any and every psychical subject in an arching metapsychological model is quite questionable. As should be apparent from my prior citations of other assertions made by Lacan in the course of my arguing for the view that anxiety is related to a hystericization particularly a-vis emotions, passions, sentiments, and the like, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that Lacan elsewhere admits the existence of an anxiety generated by doubts about the feel of feelings, worries about the specters of misfelt feelings 152 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " \"several years after the seminar on f angoisse in which obsessional doubt is said to be triggered by anxiety (instead of vice versa). Debates undoubtedly could be had about whether and to what extent Lacan's comments on affects starting in the seventeenth seminar are consistent with those situated in earlier contexts (such as the tenth seminar). Fourth and finally, as regards doubt, Lacan talks about it along different lines the following year, in his famous eleventh seminar on Ihe Four Fundamental Concepts ofPsJcho-Analysis (as well as on a number of other occasions too). In addition to the doubts of obsessional neurotics, one might wonder about the functions and significance of doubt in nonobsessional analysand-subjects; one also might wonder about doubts on the side of the listening analyst apart from those on the side of the speaking analysand. All I need to point out in the current setting is that Lacan's multifaceted izations of doubt subsequent to the tenth seminar are far from pigeonholing it as nothing more than a defense against anxiety mounted exclusively by sional neurotics in analysis.' As seen, my excavation of the rudiments of a Lacan-inspired ogy of affects-this metapsychology of affects is both centered on the thesis that, like knowing and thinking according to psychoanalysis, feeling also is non-self-reflexive and a theoretical framework potentially compatible with the neurosciences-derives many of its findings from the seventeenth nar. And, as I mentioned a while ago (in chapter 8), this seminar recently has attracted a lot of attention from Lacanians interested in exploring Lacan's course on affect and, in so doing, providing additional testimony to the effect that Lacan isn't guilty, as regularly and recurrently charged by a chorus of ics, of an unpardonable silence on this psychoanalytically unavoidable subject matter. However, these contemporary Lacanian scholars don't address those parts of the seventeenth seminar scrutinized earlier here; instead, they share an exclusive preoccupation with a few passing observations Lacan utters about shame at the opening and closing moments of the final seminar session (June 17, 1970) of this academic year.6 Jacques-Alain Miller and others argue that, in surrounding collective atmospheres infused with the lingering scents of Paris's May '68 and everything of which this convulsive outburst was a symptom, Lacan sees fit to make his audience aware of the historically unprecedented shamelessness so widespread in the crass, materialistic world of consumerist mass-media late capitalism7 (a vulgar, exhibitionistic shamelessness on display among some of the provocative agitators in the audience when Lacan spoke at EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł IS3 \",\n",
       " 'Vincennes in 8 The lines drawn of shame in Lacanian summarized by me \",\\',,,n,prp 9 will not be further in what fol-lows. Instead, my reflections will zero in on the implications of Lacan\\'s few scant-but-allusive comments on the topic of shame for a psychoanalytic theory of affective life whose relevance isn\\'t confined to a postmodern era of cheap plastic toys and television reality shows. As with his renowned recasting of the superego in the twentieth seminar,lO Lacan\\'s perspectives on shame are situated in two registers simultaneously: one more historical and contextual, the other more structural and transcontextual (i.e., metapsychological). Joan Copjec is among those notable Lacanian scholars who highlight Lacan\\'s calls for a bit more shame at the last meeting of the seventeenth nar. In particular, her essay \"May\\' 68, The Emotional Month\" is a careful, sophisticated historical contextualization of this academic year, an academic year situated in an unsettled cultural and political climate palpably perturbed by the aftershocks of France\\'s mass uprisings of students and workers alike. Copjec\\'s meticulous, thoughtful exploration of Lacanian shame gets well and truly underway thus: \"In response to May\\' 68, a very emotional month, he ends his seminar, his long warning against the rampant and misguided ism of the university students, with an impassioned plea for a display of shame. Curb your impudence, your shamelessness, he exhorts, cautioning: you should be ashamed! What effrontery! What a provocation is this seminar! But then: what are we to make of it? Because the reference to shame appears so abruptly only in the final session and without elaboration, this is not an easy question to answer.\"ll Like other recent readers of Lac an\\'s appeals to shame in 1970, Copjec seems to adopt an angle of exegetical approach privileging the sociohistorical motivations behind and resonance of these appeals. And yet, Copjec\\'s ing efforts to answer her opening question regarding shame (\"what are we to make of it ?\") reveal a convergence of interests between her endeavors in this essay and the project I\\'m pursuing here. In both cases, the seventeenth seminar, admittedly situated as it is in such intensely determinative cultural \\nand tutional circumstances, is interpreted as saying things about affect that go well beyond the limits of its proximity to the event of May\\' 68. Of course, Lacan does intervene in manners intended to address those of his auditors gripped by the passions of their specific time and place; these interventions indeed speak to a peculiar late-capitalist Zeitgeist differing in important respects from the era enveloping Freud. But, apropos affects and their delineation in psychoanalysis (not to mention a number of other topics too), the Lacan of 154 Ł MISFELT FEE,LINGS ',\n",
       " 'remains as committed as forward Freud\\'s theoretical framework as he becomes, in this academic year especially, concerned with revising and refining Freudian metapsychology by putting this conceptual apparatus into a dialectical rapport with the evident facts of new widespread phenomena unknown to and unforeseen by FreudY Again, a transcontextual metapsychology of affects can and should ate resources from the Lacan of this event-conditioned context of post-May \\'68 Paris. However, despite some overlap at the level of aims and approaches, I part company from Copiec with respect to two key matters: the question of scious affect in general and the understanding of the significance of the words affect and shame in Lacan\\'s texts in particular. To begin with the first of these differences, Copiec reiterates several times the Lacanian assertion, edly resting on firm Freudian foundations, that, in terms of being repressed, \"affect never is.\"l3 Invoking \"Freud\\'s critical assertion that only ideas are ever repressed:\\' she maintains: \"Affect remains on the surface. This does not mean that repression has no effect on affect [jouissance l; it means, rather, that this effect is something other than the removal of affect from consciousness. The specific effect of repression on affect is displacement. Affect is always displaced, or: always out of place.\"l4 Copiec takes Lacan\\'s word that affects, according to Freud, cannot succumb to the psychical vicissitude of repression insofar as they are feelings. This is problematic for several reasons: Not only does this claim ignore the different terms Freud employs when discussing affective life (i.e., Affekt, Gefuhl, and Empjindung), but it also wrongly alleges that Freud tently and categorically denies the existence of emotional phenomena below the superficial threshold of explicit conscious awareness. As shown previously, there are a plethora of instances, starting as early as 1907, in which Freud ders the possibility of unconscious affect. But, what\\'s more, the place in which Freud purportedly issues the decisive decree stating that affects can only ever be displaced within consciousness instead of repressed into unconsciousness-the place in question, regularly cited by Lacan and those sympathetic to his views on this point, is the third section (\"Unconscious Emotions\") of the logical paper on \"The Unconscious\" (I9IS)-is far from decisive. As revc2Jed by my earlier detailed examination of Freud\\'s German, Freud wavers in relation to this topic even within the span of this single three-page section. And, as will be seen shortly, what his hesitations and oscillations therein (ignored by Lacan and Copiec, as well as many others) reveal has consequences for the Lacanian handling of shame as an affect. EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł ISS ',\n",
       " 'Another limitation to Copjec\\'s reading of Lacan\\'s seventeenth seminar is its relative neglect of the nuances and subtleties of the remarks regarding affect (remarks unpacked at length in chapter II) in all but the final session of that academic year. Like a handful of other Lacanians, she devotes most of her tion to shame as it appears in that year\\'s last meeting. However, like Alenka ZupanCic,ls Copjec rightly observes that this annual seminar involves, among other things, Lacan reworking his long-standing black-and-white dichotomy between the signifier (as the intellectual-representational) and jouissance (as the affective-libidinal).16 jouis-sens, with its muddied shades of gray, begins to crystallize at this moment. And yet, none of this leads to questioning skeptically the old story, erroneously imputed to the authority of Freud, about affects as nothing more than mobile lumps in the carpet of consciousness set in motion by being pushed about (i.e., displaced) as a secondary result of the effects of defense mechanisms (repression first and foremost) operating exclusively on ideational and mnemic materials. Although both Freud and Lacan sometimes articulate conceptions of affects along these lines, a comprehensive survey of their various and varying pronouncements bearing upon matters of passions renders such a clear-cut, straightforward depiction of affect in Lacanian psychoanalysis (as never repressed, as always displaced) suspect. Furthermore, when this survey takes into account the precise German and French phrasings of these pronouncements, the picture gets even more complex. Sometimes sounding audibly frustrated and contemptuous, Lacan tirelessly pleads with his audience to acquaint themselves with Freud\\'s texts in their inal tongue, insisting that fundamental conceptual understandings and derstandings hinge on whether or not one gains adequate access to the syntax and semantics of the German language in which the founding documents of psychoanalysis are written. The devil resides in the details not only in the cal setting of the analyst\\'s consulting room. Although Lacan\\'s neglect of the translation and interpretation difficulties posed by the German words Freud employs in his discussions of affective life is a notably rare and uncharacteristic exception to the former\\'s own rule-this exception indeed proves the rule far as these strangely neglected German concept-terms arguably come back to haunt Lacan\\'s own analytic understanding and handling of affects-a return to Lacan interested in affect must scrutinize the French used by the \"French Freud.\" When it comes to affect-language of all sorts, the distinctions between connotatiofoLs of words for affective phenomena in various natural languages are crucial to observe for at least two reasons: first, different natural languages splice up and organize fluid emotional spectrums differently; second, these 156 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'affective hues are not without real and direct repercussions for the affective lives of the beings whose visceral emotions and feelings are mediated the very languages that they speak. In fact, particularly when it comes to an English-language exegesis of a language discourse on shame, this sensitivity to linguistic precision is especially crucial. Copjec contends that Lacan\\'s talk of shame in 1970 is far from edented in his teachings, citing, among other references, his famous seventh seminar of a decade priorP This is where certain problems begin to arise. The French word translated as \"shame\" at the end of the seventeenth seminar is honte,l8 and this final session of that academic year is one of only three sions on which Lacan speaks, briefly and in passing, of honte in Ie Seminaire (the other two occur in seminars eight and eleven,l9 with Copjec citing the latter but not the former). A different French word, pudeur (also translated as \"shame\"), is used by Lacan in the majority of those contexts referenced or alluded to by Copjec as precursors of his post-May \\'68 revival of shame. But, how do honte and pudeur differ from each other? Moreover, what difference does recognizing this English-elided terminological distinction make? Why is this important, particularly as regards a psychoanalytic metapsychology of affect? The contrast between honte and pudeur consists in the former word ring to an affect as a felt feeling (i.e., as a consciously registered sensation gibly experienced) and the latter word referring to a predisposition toward being capable of feeling certain feelings. Simply put: \"Honte is shame as an excruciatingly uncomfortable, embarrassed feeling actually felt (as in \\'I feel ashamed right now\\'). By contrast, pudeur is the potential capacity for or ceptibility to experiencing honte, a capacity/susceptibility that, in the form of the ethico-moral self-restraints of what is sometimes called \\'modesty\\' or \\'tact: keeps one from crossing lines or transgressing those boundaries that would produce an actually felt upsurge of negative affect (as in, apropos a person ing this tactful modesty, \\'Have you no shame?\\').\"2o Interestingly, this French semantic difference can be correlated with Freud\\'s previously traced German distinction between Empjindung (feeling) and Affiktbildung (affective ture or formation): Honte designates a felt feeling qua Empjindung, whereas pudeur designates a potential to feel qua Affiktbildung (rather than a feeling felt in actuality); indeed, German allows for a distinction between Scham and SchamgeJuhl (as per the title of a book by Max Scheler) corresponding to that between pudeur and honte, respectively. Accordingly, honte, as an Empjindung, EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł IS7 ',\n",
       " 'is a conscious experience involving a specific set of sensations; by contrast, pudeur, as an A.ffektbildung, involves chains of ideational representations that can be either conscious or unconscious (as in the Freudian superego, a science not all of which is conscious). To say that honte and pudeur both mean \"shame\" in the same sense and are both words for an \"affect\" in the same sense would be inaccurate and misleading. In fact, if one identifies pudeur qua A.ffektbildung as an affect, then, contra the Lacanian line adhered to by Copjec, one concedes the existence of scious affects, unless one is willing to contradict Freud\\'s well-supported and explanatorily invaluable contention that much of the superego, itself sible for intrapsychically enforcing modest, tactful restraint (pudeur), is scious. In her analyses of shame in Lacan\\'s teachings, Copjec\\'s lovely, polished English, usually so deft and illuminating, reveals a tendency to conflate the two senses of shame as honte and pudeur. While addreSSing shame (as honte) in the seventeenth seminar, she claims this to be a continuation of preceding nian reflections on shame (generally as pudeur), proceeding to present all of these scattered instances in Lacan\\'s seminars as occasions on which Lacan les the problem of affect (with no mention made of crucial distinctions such as those between Empfindung and A.ffektbildung, actual and potential affects, and so on).21 Admittedly, Lacan, once in a while permitting himself a more relaxed tionship to his native French tongue, sometimes lapses into an indistinction between honte and pudeur allowed for in nontechnical quotidian speech. In the sixth seminar, when describing the blush of a miser provoked by another\\'s gaze glimpsing the unveiled secret treasure of one of his hoarded \"intimate objects,\" Lacan employs pudeur as synonymous with honte to designate the felt feeling of embarrassment.22 In the eighth seminar, honte and pudeur are used in close proximity to each other.23 However, these few aberrant and casual cations between honte and pudeur aside (not to mention the rare references to honte alone in the eleventh and seventeenth seminars), the rest of Lac an\\'s linked, cross-resonating remarks on \"shame\" (pudeur) implicitly but clearly pertain not to shame as an affect (i.e., honte qua Empjindung, an excruciating, burning affective state of consciousness), but to affective structures or tions (A.ffektbildungen) enforcing a limiting restraint, in the forms of modesty and tact (whether consciously or unconsciously respected), through the tial to produce the feelings of embarrassment, humiliation, and so on. Starting in the fifth seminar and the contemporaneous ecrit \"The fication of the Phallus,\" Lacan repeatedly summons the \"demon of shame\" IS8 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'demon de This invocation occurs with reference ture of \"the terrified woman\" from the frescos of the Villa of the M\\\\l<t/\\'rll\\'\" at Pompeii (the image-scene depicting this recoiling female adorns the cover of the French edition of Lacan\\'s Television published in 1973),2\\' Lacan interprets this painted ancient woman, at the threshold of a type passage, as horrified precisely by the sudden unveiling of the phallus; she is said to embody the shame qua modesty (i.e., pudeur) that is integrally complicit in sustaining the apparent potency of this symbolic entity through refusing to tear aside the layers of cloth beneath which it normally remains hidden.26 Among other things, the Lacanian phallus signifies a potent ness and vital fullness (\"by virtue of its turgidity ... the image of the vital flow as it is transmitted in generation\") both inaccessible and unattainable for speaking subjects; as such, this illusory x effectively functions as a lure solely when its presence is hinted at indirectly through screens and disguises (\"it can play its role only when veiled\").27 According to the general Lacanian logic of the curtain or veil, coverings sustain the sense that there is something being covered, a substantial thing concealed behind the barrier of a Through this effect, curtains or veils, such as those covering phallic entities, even can create the illusion of something where there is nothing.28 Alluring avatars and promises of phallic power and completion retain their seductive aura solely insofar as respectful restraint (again,pudeur) stays the hand that might otherwise, in aiming to seize such phalli directly, inadvertently tear away masks hiding nothing, thus disrupting the masquerade by calling its bluff (and ending up empty-handed in the process). Immodestly and lessly tossing aside the crowns of kings and the gavels of judges reveals the near nothingness of mere mortals, of miserable, fragile animal bodies. Those who are shameless (sans pudeur, sans vergogne), like children who have yet to know shame, are prone to blurt out such disturbing truths as that the lic emperor is naked, that emperor-phallus is nothing more than a sagging, wrinkled bit of spent flesh (and not, as it appears when veiled, an eternally erect font of an indestructible life force). Like both Freud\\'s \"little Hans\" and his curious young fetishist-to-be, those who peer behind the ornamental erings of clothes see-oh! horror of horrors-gaping absence where eager anticipation expected full, protruding presence. When the limits maintained by pudeur are disrespected and violated, honte and disgust tend to arise.29 These affects (as felt feelings, as Empjindungen) are symptomatic of ity itself as constituted partially on the basis of restraining barriers and ders,30 of limiting constraints of which pudeur qua Affiktbildung (sometimes EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł 159 ',\n",
       " 'conscious, sometimes unconscious) is an instance (\"the dimension of shame, a dimension that is proper only to the subject as such\").3J The seventh seminar, turned to by Copjec in her commentary on shame a la Lacan,32 enriches and extends these observations regardingpudeur. Lacan\\'s contemplations therein bearing on beauty playa key role in this vein: \"The true barrier that holds the subject back in front of the unspeakable field of radical desire that is the field of absolute destruction, of destruction beyond tion, is properly speaking the aesthetic phenomenon where it is identified with· the experience of beauty-beauty in all its shining radiance, beauty that has been called the splendor of truth. It is obviously because truth is not pretty to look at that beauty is, if not its splendor, then at least its envelope.\"33 In terms of Lac an\\'s preceding discussions of pudeur apropos the phallus, the ugly truth concealed by material and not-so-material veils is (symbolic) castration, the fact that there is nothing equal to the phallic fac;ade, nothing measuring up to this impossible standard. The curtains covering this bitter, distasteful ciency can use the ruses of aesthetic appeal, of decorative adornments, to hide or dress up any small, hairy disappointments, \\nwhoever or whatever they may be. Later on in the seventh seminar, Lacan links the \"limit\" of beauty as the barrier, curtain, envelope, or veil of truth to the specter of death: 34 \"I wanted to show you how the function of the Signifier in permitting the subject\\'s access to his relationship to death might be made more concrete than is possible through a connotation. That is why I have tried to have you recognize it in our recent meetings in an aesthetic form, namely, that of the beautiful-it being precisely the function \\nof the beautiful to reveal to us the site of man\\'s relationship to his own death, and to reveal it to us only in a blinding flash.\"35 Coming quickly on the heels of his commentary on Sophocles\\'s Antigone, one example of a \"blinding flash\" of beauty Lacan undoubtedly has in mind here is the fascinating dramatic-tragic figure of \"Antigone in her unbearable splendor.\"36 Another example that may be suitable in this context is the tion of Christ as a fetishized martyr associated with certain styles of cism in particular, a depiction lingering with obscene,jouissance-Iaden relish over every detail of his wounded bare body. In both cases, an aesthetic tion or sublimation of suffering unto death covers over doomed-to-rot sexed skin in the gleaming sheen of art\\'s mercifully distracting, cathartic pleasures. Lacan proceeds to draw parallels between beauty and shame. He begins this by noting: \"I should like to introduce here, as a parallel to the function \\nof the beautiful, another function. I have named it on a number of occasions without emphasizing it particularly, but it seems to me essential to refer to it here. It 160 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'is with your permission what I shall call or, in other words, a sense of shame. The omission of this barrier, which prevents the direct experience of that which is to be found at the center of sexual union, seems to me to be at the origin of all kinds of questions that cannot be answered.\"37The shame at stake here is again pudeur.38 At first, one might think that, for Lacan, shame is to sex what beauty is to death: just as beauty shields the mortal subject from the blunt, unmitigated experiential effects (or affects) of facing the ugly truth of its own unglorious mortality with no fantasmatic embellishments and illusions, so too is shame something that \"prevents the direct experience of that which is to be found at the center of sexual union\" (or, as Lacan later puts it, pudeur as a modest restraint shields one from the truth that \"it n\\'y a pas de rapport sexuel. \")39 But, additional remarks in both the seventh seminar and subsequent contexts indicate that Lacan, in good Freudian fashion, refuses to partition sex and death as two cleanly distinct topics, thus problematizing the neat tion of when they are correlated to shame and beauty, respectively. Soon after comparing beauty and shame as parallel defensive both serve in protective capacities relative to painful facts4°-Lacan asks, \"Do the fantasm of the phallus and the beauty of the human image find their legitimate place at the same level?\"41 Arguably, this is a rhetorical question, the answer to which is \"Yes.\" Why? For Freudian-Lacanian psychoanalysis, sex and death are mutually entangled in multiple manners. In connection with this, the aesthetics of phallic sexuality require repressing from view, through the artful manipulation of veils Qf various sorts, an underbelly of time-ravaged, cent flesh spitting out spluttering trickles of smelly discharges. Even when two sexual partners face each other in their apparent nakedness, a nakedness which really isn\\'t so naked thanks to the interplay of fantasmatic projections between them,42 each must unknowingly coat both bodies there in layers of fantasies making possible the effect or affect of sexiness. The masquerades of such fantasy-supported sexuality wrap titillating films of spectral images and meanings around a repulsively rotten core of senseless filth, of idiotic, pointless enjoyment driven along by the raw facticity of a sexuality coupled with ity.43 In later seminars, Lacan indeed speaks of pudeur vis-a.-vis the anxieties and horrors of the faceless Real of death-tinged sexuality.44 If Lacanian pudeur (over and above honte qua Empjindung, the felt feeling of shame as embarrassment, humiliation, and so on) is qualified as something affective, then the truly subtle dimensions of Lacan\\'s underdeveloped, largely tacit metapsychology of affect present a much more intricate picture than is commonly assumed by the majority of his readers. In other words, this would EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł 161 ',\n",
       " 'mean that Lacan doesn\\'t the existence of unconscious in this instance, he wouldn\\'t reduce affective to the status of residual, epiphenomenal conscious by-products of unconscious formations solely comprising tive structures of pure signifiers. Again, if pudeur is affective, then the Lacanian unconscious is not without affect. But, this remains quite vague insofar as it raises a series of yet-to-be-answered questions, questions Lacan himself doesn\\'t explicitly address: Is the distinction between honte and pudeur to be lined up in a way that corresponds to the distinction between actual and potential affects, respectively? Can honte or pudeur be misfelt, that is, consciously tered and reflexively interpreted as affective hues other than themselves? larly but differently, can honte or pudeur be enlisted in intra-affective defensive maneuvers in which one consciously feels ashamed or modest so as to avoid feeling other possible feelings instead, in which case these defended-against other (potential) feelings would be, in a certain sense, unconscious? The most effective and productive way to handle these difficulties bequeathed to temporary thought by Freud and Lacan is to interface their metapsychologies with the neurosciences. Some of Zizek\\'s recent work constructs a very useful and unconventional bridge between Lacanian psychoanalytic theory and neuroscientific accounts of emotional life and affective selfhood or subjectivity. Interestingly, there is evidence that Zizek admits the existence of unconscious affects, a controversial admission in psychoanalysis generally and Lacanianism especially. On at least one occasion, he speaks of guilt, in faithful Freudian fashion, as \"ultimately unconscious:\\'45 In this context, he even indicates two modes in which guilt can be unconscious: (I) \"the subject is unaware of his or her guilt\" (i.e., an unfelt feeling), and (2) \"he or she, while experiencing the pressure of guilt, is unaware of what he or she is guilty of\" (i.e., an enigmatic, free-floating feeling).46 The latter mode arguably also could be (or morph into) a misfelt feeling: in the absence of an explicit cognizance of culpability apropos a misdeed relative to a certain rule, the feeling that might otherwise be self-interpretively felt as guilt is consciously registered as some other affective tonality (such as anxiety, vousness, vague discomfort, or even physical illness). Zizek\\'s book The Parallax View (published in 2006) contains detailed engagements with the sciences of the brain. Among other figures in this set of disciplines, he turns his attention to Damasio in particular, specifically the latter\\'s neuroscience-based theories of emotional matters elaborated primarily in the book The Feeling o/What Happens (published in 1999). Before turning 162 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'to what has to say a few remarks should be made abour the ideas and of the latter. To with, Damasio is generally to psychoanalysis and pathetic to the neuro-psychoanalytic movement in Anglo-American clinical analytic circles; for instance, he sits on the Neuroscience Editorial Advisory Board of the journal Neuro-Psychoanalysis, of which Solms is one of the ing editors.47 Damasio (and, in fact, neuroscience as a whole) fundamentally accepts an unconscious along the lines of that described by analytic chology.48 What\\'s more, whereas the notion of unconscious affect remains troversial in certain sectors of psychoanalysis-for many Lacanians, the phrase \"unconscious affect\" is oxymoronic-Damasio (and, as will be seen, many of his fellow researchers investigating the emotional brain) posits the reality of affective phenomena below the threshold of self-awareness.49 Like Freud, he even acknowledges the ostensibly unavoidable awkwardness of proposing that there are feelings that aren\\'t felt as such: \"Someone may suggest that perhaps we should have another word for \\'feelings that are not conscious: but there isn\\'t one.\"so In the three shadows cast by Freud, Lacan, and Zizek, the current sion, with its selective focus, will be limited to touching upon Damasio\\'s ion of distinguishing between \"emotions\" and \"feelings\" (as well as between nonconscious and conscious feelings). Properly understanding this Damasian distinction requires initially noting that Damasio insists, as I\\'ve done here too, on the essentially mediated nature of human beings\\' affective lives, on the ineliminable modulation (even constitution) of passions and sentiments by intellectual, linguistic, and representational configurations.sl To put it in the language of the neuroscience trinity of cognition, emotion, \\nand motivation, the emotional brain cannot be separated from the cognitive brains2 (not to mention the motivational brain, whose facets also are of great importance to psychoanalysis, with its reliance on a theory of drives). For Damasio, emotions are, by his definition, non conscious phenomena, rather than, as in quotidian parlance, felt feelings. To be more precise, asian emotions are phYSiological processes visible to third-party observers; feelings, by contrast, are private, first-person phenomena.53 He thus aligns emotions with the publicly accessible body and feelings with the publicly cessible mind.s4 However, Damasio is far from resting content with an fensibly simplistic opposition between a non conscious body of phYSiological emotions and a conscious mind of psychological feelings. This becomes clear in Damasio\\'s delineation of a three-stage diachronic sequence running from EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN ',\n",
       " 'and conscious emo-tions \"I separate three stages of pro-cessing along a continuum: state which can be triggered and executed nonconsciously; a state of fleling, which can be represented sciously; and a state offoeling made conscious, i.e., known to the organism ing both emotion and feeling.\"56 The second of these three stages is where Damasio is perhaps at his most psychoanalytic. On his account, the human brain is a compulsive, reflexive modeler, constantly generating map-like depictions of the states of the subject\\'s body, its world of objects, and the ongoing interactions between these two enmeshed poles (with consciousness being an outgrowth of these self-mapping dynamics).5? The conceptions and pictures thus formed can be, in Damasio\\'s view, either conscious or nonconscious.58 He\\'s entirely open about his reliance on the (originally Freudian) assertion according to which the large domain of mental life that isn\\'t conscious contains not only motivational energies and impulses (as per the pseudo-Freudian notion of the unconscious as the dark depths of a writhing, primordial animal id), but also cognitive images and representations (something Lacan adamantly insists upon again and again in his \"return to Freud\"): \"Images may be conscious or unconscious. It should be noted, however, that not all the images the brain constructs are made conscious. There are simply too many images being generated and too much competition for the relatively small window of mind in which images can be made conscious-the window, that is, in which images are accompanied by a sense that we are apprehending them and that, as a consequence, are erly attended. In other words, metaphorically speaking, there is indeed a terranean underneath the conscious mind and there are many levels to that subterranean.\"59 With the preceding details in mind, a better appreciation of the nuances and potentials of Damasio\\'s fine-grained distinctions concerning affective life is now possible. Damasio states: \"This perspective on emotion, feeling, and knowing is unorthodox. First, I am suggesting that there is no tral feeling state before the respective emotion occurs, that expression tion) precedes feeling. Second, I am suggesting that \\'having a feeling\\' is not the same as \\'knowing a feeling: that reflection on feeling is yet another step up. Overall, this curious situation reminds me ofE. M. Forster\\'s words: \\'How can I know what I think before I say it ?\"\\'60 Emotions are \"expressions\" in the sense of physiological processes fested by the body (everything from heart rates and adrenalin releases to ing and sweating). These bodily states then are cognitively mapped, translated MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'into Such maps of emotions, constructed the spontaneous activities of a brain that \"is the cap-rive audience;\\'61 be feelings in Damasio\\'s However, he stipulates that feelings thus defined are not automatically and necessarily scious (i.e., consciously felt feelings, Freudian Empfindungen). As Damasio postulates, one can \"have a feeling\" (as a non conscious or unconscious image or representation of an emotion qua physiological condition) without ing it.62 (Jean-Pierre Changeux, another neuroscientist, likewise observes that \"the direct experience of feeling is readily distinguished from the knowledge that one has a feeling.\")63 And, perhaps there are two modes in which this gap between having and knowing can exist: on the one hand, the feeling is tended to by first-person consciousness (i.e., it\\'s an unfelt feeling), or, on the other hand, the feeling is interpreted by first-person consciousness (i.e., it\\'s a misfelt feeling, examples of which might include the conscious registration of varieties of affective excitation as anxiety or of guilt as physical distress). At this point, it\\'s tempting to establish one-to-one correspondences between the affective trinities of Freud and Damasio: Ajfekt (affect) is emotion (for choanalysis, this emotionally expressive body is already itself saturated by the denaturalizing influences of intertwined cognitive-ideational and tional-libidinal dimensions); Gefuhl (emotion) is feeling-had (which can be unconscious, as in unconscious gUilt it la Freud [unbewujSte SchuldgifUhlJ); and Empjindung (feeling) is feeling-known (which would be \"feeling\" in the everyday, nontechnical sense of the word). Damasio\\'s work on affective life should be of great interest for sis, including even Lacanian theory. (ZiZek once more, as in other respects too, is an admirable and rare exception, being one of the all-too-few Lacanians to address seriously the advances achieved by Damasio and the neurosciences as a whole; by contrast, Anglo-American neuro-psychoanalysis indeed has siastically embraced affective neuroscience.) From a Freudian-Lacanian spective, several features of the approach to parsing the affective phenomena selectively summarized immediately strike the eye. As in Freudian chology, Damasio\\'s intermediary realm of feelings-had, situated in a ing capacity between nonconscious emotions and conscious feelings-known, consists of Triebreprasentanzen (drive representatives), namely, the cal inscriptions both structurally articulated and energetically charged that form the coordinates of the drives\\' aims (Ziele) and objects (Objekte). Along related Lacanian lines, one cannot help but think of jouis-sens, of the hybrid juxtapositions and unstable syntheses of (in Freud\\'s terms) soma and psyche, EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł 165 ',\n",
       " 'of something neither strictly corporeal-libidinal nor subjective-meaningfu1.64 Additionally, the line from Forster quoted by Damasio also elegantly sulates Lacan\\'s take on an aspect of free association in the analytic process, a take in which the analysand, as a parletre voicing his/her thoughts and desires, comes to figure out what he/she really thinks and wants through the verbal labor of associational expression itself (rather than a take in which free tion merely helps to reveal what already was present beforehand fully formed in the repressed recesses of the speaking subject\\'s psyche).65 Before turning to Zizek\\'s critical comments on Damasio, a quick tion of the latter\\'s book Lookingfor Spinoza, published in 2003, promises to be helpful and relevant (in part because it further clarifies arguments and cepts first delineated in 1he Feeling of What Happens). Damasio\\'s Spinozism is expressed via the assertion, taken straight from part 2 of the Ethics (especially propositions 13 and 23), that \"the human mind is the idea of the human body.\"66 For Damasio, an obvious extension of this, in connection with his distinction between emotions and feelings, is the proposition that \"feelings ... are mostly shadows of the external manner of emotions:\\'67 Again, emotions are \"external\" insofar as they are corporeal expressions made manifest as physiological nomena potentially if not actually observable by third parties. Moreover, as indicated, they are, in and of themselves, nonconscious; they can be translated into consciously registered experiences in the guise of feelings, but they aren\\'t automatically and necessarily thus registered. In this vein, Damasio this observation obviously dovetails with assertions central to Freudian analysis-that pleasure and pain (as emotion-level bodily events) don\\'t need the mediation of conscious experience to generate and guide behaviors.68 He goes on to indicate that this independence relative to consciousness is enjoyed by emotions generally.69 Damasio, in line with the thesis that the mind consists of ideational tions of the body, defines feelings (as mental, distinct from physical, emotions) as representations of body-states (i.e., the body\\'s changing conditions and its ongoing interactions with entities and circumstances affecting it)?O He ceeds to elaborate: \"Feelings are perceptions, and I propose that the most essary support for their perception occurs in the brain\\'s body maps. These maps refer to parts of the body and states of the body. Some variation of pleasure or pain is a consistent content of the perception we call feeling.\"71 He continues: Alongside the perception of the body there is the perception of thoughts with themes consonant with the emotion, and a perception of a certain mode of 166 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'of me mal How does this \"\"\" ... come abour? It results from of our own mental process, a operation in which a part of the mind represents another part of the mind. This allows us to register the fact thilt our thoughts slow down or speed up as more or less attention is devoted to them; or the fact that thoughts depict objects and events at close range or at a distance, My hypothesis, then, presented in the form of a provisional definition, is that a feeling is the tion of a certain state of the body along with the perception of a certain mode of thinking and of thoughts with certain themes. Feelings emerge when the sheer accumulation of mapped details reaches a certain stage.72 As Damasio summarizes all of this a few pages later, \"A feeling of tion is an idea of the body when it is perturbed by the emoting process.\"73 From a psychoanalytic angle, a number of details in these passages warrant commentary. As I suggested earlier, the pleasure-and-pain-infused \"body maps;\\' themselves not necessarily conscious but capable of becoming so in the trappings of the ideational-representational material of feelings, can be associated with Freudian drive representatives (composing configurations of libidinal aims and objects) and Lacanian jouis-sens (itself written in the fluid \"language\" of lalangue). These Damasian maps, continually drafted and updated by the perpetual self-modeling activity of the brain, are essary-but-not-sufUcient conditions for the experience of somatic emotions as psychical felt feelings: \"an entity capable of feeling must be an ism that not only has a body but also a means to represent that body inside itself.\"74 What\\'s more, this mapping process is the first step of a two-step translation process at the end of which emerge feelings-known ungen), affective phenomena consciously experienced. In addition to the initial step from emotions to maps as (proto )affective formations (a step in which representations of body parts and relations with exogenous objects must be integrated), a subsequent step from such maps to tions\" (in which cognitive styles and contents must be linked and sized) is requisite for the genesis of a consciously felt feeling?S Although Damasio repeatedly acknowledges that something like the psychoanalytic unconscious plays a role in the vicissitudes of affective life,76 his discussions of the trajectories of translation leading from emotions through had to feelings-known tend to pass over quickly and quietly features of this multistep movement with respect to which a Freudian-Lacanian chology of affect has \\na lot to say. EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN ',\n",
       " 'The Lacanian rendition of the Freudian unconscious as at in twists, turns, and gaps inscribed within rhe surface of consciousness is worth recalling at this is well known, Lacan is adamantly opposed to the vulgar depiction of psychoanalysis as a hermeneutic depth psychology, an exploration of hidden pockets of profound meaning.)77 To be more precise, the psychoanalytic unconscious (and not the vague analytic notion of the nonconscious) exists, in part, as events of interventions intervening between different components and operations along the line ning from one end ofDamasio\\'s affective spectrum to the other, from scious emotions to conscious feelings. In other words, the unconscious isn\\'t itself a deep, obfuscated component or operation of the complex ensemble of affective machinery, but instead is something slipping into the intervals of spacing distinguishing emotions, feelings-had, and feelings-known. It even can and does affect the linkings internal to both feelings-had and feelings-known, that is, the linkings of body parts, states, and surrounding circumstances in Damasian feelings-had (i.e., first-order representations in the form of body maps mapping the far-from-elementary complexes that are emotions) as well as the linkings of cognitive modes and themes in Damasian feelings-known (i.e., second-order \"metarepresentations\" as reflective appreciations of affective experiences ). Put differently and more generally, the unconscious of intrapsychical defense mechanisms (i.e., the unconscious that is repressed, with \"repression\" to be taken here in its broadest possible analytic sense) is not reducible to any set of particular content-nodes in the networks of the psyche insofar as it cally slides between these nodes. Repression often bears on associative relations between pieces of psychical content. For example, in an analysis, an analysand might very well be able consciously to recollect every specific fragment of mnemic material involved in a given constellation underpinning a particular symptom. In such a case, what is repressed isn\\'t one memory among others, but instead the web of associations woven between the memories ing nodes in the network producing symptoms as its outgrowths. The relations between memories are repressed, rather than the memories themselves. The unconscious comes to light in such analytic circumstances as newly recognized connections between previously recognized contents. Whereas Damasio speaks of organic \"consonances\" between the different layers and levels of his affective spectrum, a psychoanalytic approach, taking up his model, would prefer to emphasize dissonances. More precisely, by tue of the psyche\\'s defensive means of achieving a self-regulated homeostatic 168 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

Additionally, this analytic metapsychological supplement to Damasio\\'s theory rectifies what appears to be one of its shortcomings: asio seems to suggest entertaining the unconvincing hypothesis that a simple, straightforward quantitative factor is responsible for the qualitative shift from nonconscious affective mechanisms to felt affective qualia (\"Feelings emerge when the sheer accumulation of mapped details reaches a certain stage\"). By contrast, an analytic approach would speculate that much more than \"sheer\" quantity alone is at work here. In several contexts, Damasio somewhat enigmatically refers to what he characterizes as \"feelings of feelings.\"78 At this point, an examination ofZiZek\\'s Lacanian criticisms of Damasio\\'s account of affective life is appropriate and promises to be productive. Zizek devotes a certain amount of attention to a topic I did not delve into earlier, namely, the theory of the multiple degrees and strata of consciousness and selfhood in Ihe Feeling of What Happens (in which Damasio sets out such conceptual categories as protoselfhood, core sciousness or selfhood, extended consciousness, autobiographical selfhood, and conscience),79 On this score, Zizek\\'s complaint is that reducing ity to the two dimensions of embodied being (as protoselfhood and core sciousness or selfhood) and linguistic-representational identity (as extended consciousness, autobiographical selfhood, and conscience) leaves out the third dimension first isolated by Descartes in the figure of the Cogito (i.e., the subject proper as the emptiness of the negativity of $, Lacan\\'s \"barred subject\\',):8o Damasio\\'s solution to the old enigma of the two sides of Self (Self qua the continuously changing stream of consciousness verses Self qua the permanent stable core of our subjectivity) misses the mark: \"the seemingly changing self and the seemingly permanent self, although closely related, are not one entity but two\" -the first being the Core Self, the second the autobiographical Self There is no place here, however, for what we as speaking beings experience (or, rather, presuppose) as the empty core of our subjectivity: what am I? I am neither my body (I have a body, I never \"am\" my body directly, in spite of all the subtle phenomenological descriptions a la Merleau-Ponry that try to convince me to the contrary), nor the stable core of my autobiographical narratives that form my symbolic identity; what \"I am\" is the pure One of an empty Self which remains the same One throughout the constant change EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN ',\n",
       " 'of autobiographical narratives. This One is engendered by language: it is ther the Core Self nor the autobiographical Self, but what the Core Self is transubstantiated (or, rather, desubstantialized) into when it is transposed into language. This is what Kant has in mind when he distinguishes between the \"person\" (the wealth of autobiographical content that provides tial content to my Self) and the pure subject of transcendental apperception which is just an empty point of self-relating.81 The entire philosophical framework informing this critique ofDamasio not be exhaustively elucidated here insofar as this would require reconstructing the entirety of the Zizekian theory of subjectivity, which is constructed at the intersection of German idealism and Lacanian psychoanalysis (a tion I carry out in my book Zizek\\'s Ontology: A Transcendental Materialist Theory of Subjectivity, published in 2008). But, what\\'s crucial in this context is Zizek\\'s insistence, following Lacan, that Symbolic mediation (i.e., the sage of the substantial protosubject into the enveloping milieus of language structures) creates a subject (i.e., the Cogito-like central to tian and post-Kantian German idealism) that thereafter escapes reduction to either bodily nature (including Damasio\\'s \"Core Self\") or linguistic culture (including Damasio\\'s \"autobiographical Self\"); this could be described as a sort of immanent structural genesis of transstructural subjectivity.82 Damasio agrees with Zizek about the invalidity of reducing consciousness or selfhood to language;83 he even speculates that nonhuman animals have cal selves, thereby clearly indicating that he doesn\\'t consider this stratum of selfhood to be entirely language-bound.84 But, Damasio and Zizek certainly seem to part company apropos the latter\\'s Lacanian thesis that the corporeal. substance of the Damasian protoselves and core selves doesn\\'t remain a purely biological foundation over which is then subsequently laid utterly separate and distinct higher-order mental scaffoldings. (Lurking in the broadest passing background is what would be a much more far-reaching, fundamental debate about the extent to which sociosymbolic mediators penetrate and alter the realities of the body.) In The Feeling of What Happens, Damasio does concede that a certain amount of dialectical interaction transpires between core consciousness or selfhood and the additional tiers of different configurations of ness/selfhood overlaid on top ofit.85 And yet, Zizek is quite right that sio nonetheless tends to stick perSistently to the claim that an atomic center of substantial biomaterial being utterly untouched by nonnatural influences 170 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

However, Zizek\\'s critique ignores Damasio\\'s tinction between the protoself and the core self, conflating these two entities under the single heading of the \"Core Self.\" For Damasio, the core self is a representational map of the protoself.87 Nonetheless, in the spirit of Zizek\\'s psychoanalytically inspired objection to Damasio, it would be justifiable to maintain that the advent of language use (especially the subjectifying sition of proficiency with proper names and personal pronouns) might substantiate\" the very means and results of the translation process leading from the protoself to the core self. Put in combined Lacanian and Damasian vocabularies, an irreparable rift rendering all representational translation between the protoself as S and the core self as $ somewhat misrepresentative (a la Lacan\\'s meconnaissance) may open like a gaping wound in organisms subjected to the cutting intervention of linguistic structures. This would be the initial, zero-level introduction into the corporeal reality of human animals of the dissonances and discrepancies that come to be characteristic of split speaking subjects through whose splits culate unconscious dimensions. But, whereas Zizek sounds as though he flirts at this moment with a vaguely social-constructivist vision according to which the nature-based protoself-as-S is retroactively liquidated and replaced by the language-induced core-self-as-$ (now in the form of the Hegelian-Lacanian void of self-relating negativity), what I am proposing ently is an alternative picture in which, to articulate this in Hegelian fashion, the distinction between S (as the protoself) and $ (as the core self) persists as a distinction internal to $ itself. That is to say, not only do chasms of varying widths crack open between the language-independent protoself as S and its (un)representational (mis ) translations in and by the linguistically influenced core self as $, but a split within the core-self-as-$ mirrors this chasm, a split dividing the core self in two, into both a plastic avatar of substantial bodily being as well as a faceless blank of de substantialized negativity. In other words, maybe there are two core selves dissonant with each other (in addition to the varyingly dissonant intervals between protoselves and core selves): a \"full\" core self and an \"empty\" core self (the latter being the Cogito-like void of interest to Zizek, something admittedly neglected by Damasio).

By arguing that \"emotions are already the subject\\'s;\\' he signals his hypothesis that Damasio\\'s proto self or core self (or, more accurately, selves) is thoroughly denaturalized apres-coup by the intrusion of the signifiers of the symbolic order. Of course, one might have reservations with respect to what sounds like a hyperbolic positing of a total and complete denaturalization without reserve or remainder. As regards the (human) \"nature\" underpinning subjectivity, I prefer to conceive of denaturalization as, at least in some circumstances, more of a sedimentary accumulation, a layering of heterogeneous montages of often flicting dimensions running the gamut from the relatively \"natural\" (e.g., tionary tendencies rooted in archaic environmental contexts) to the relatively \"nonnatural\" (primarily sociohistorical factors and variables past and present). To misappropriate some ofZizek\\'s language from In Defense of Lost Causes,90 the whole problem is that \"life 2.0\" (i.e., the retroactive denaturalizer oflife as 172 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

At least in certain cases, the latter continues to operate in parallel with the former, with antagonisms and dysfunctions arising between them. Human beings, in terms of where they stand between the natural and the nonnatural, could be described as creatures of temporal torsions. Parts of human beings lag behind in the time warp of evolutionary-genetic influences linked to long-past contexts, whereas other parts, which can and do come into conflict with these same evolutionary-genetic influences, take shape according to faster-moving historical temporalities. (Moreover, the latter are themselves outgrowths of evolution that have escaped control by evolutionary governance alone.)91 Such beings are the products of incomplete, partial denaturalizations failing to eliminate without undigested leftovers the vestiges of things other than the sociosymbolically mediated structures and phenomena of human tory both phylogenetic and ontogenetic. Of course, one should edly agree with Zizek that \"Nature does not exist\" if \"Nature\" designates a balanced, harmonious One-All; this is another nonexistent big Other (as per Lacan\\'s \"Le grand Autre n\\'existe pas\").92 However, nature indeed does exist both as that which immanently allows for and generates the denaturalizations involved with subjectivity,93 and as a bundle of anachronistic variables, within the substance of human being, out of joint with various and sundry aspects of more current historical-temporal milieus. Nature is a participant in this anced ensemble of conflicting elements. So, to paraphrase Lacan\\'s \"there is no Other of the Other\" (rather than his \"the big Other does not exist\"), I assert that there is no Nature of nature, although there is nature as fragmentary, sundering components caught up in the conflicts constitutive of the \"human condition.\"94 Regardless of all this, Zizek\\'s crucial move in the passages quoted three graphs earlier is his insightful proposal that the signifier-catalyzed explosion of the emptiness of $ out of the fullness of 5, of (as per Hegel) subject proper out of substance, is not without significant repercussions in the spheres of affect. In fact, for Zizek, properly human-subjective affects are neither emotions nor feelings in Damasio\\'s senses of these latter two terms. Damasio treats tions as automatic phYSiological processes regulated by nonconscious bodily mechanisms, although he stipulates that the translation of emotions into sciously registered feelings allows for partial cognitive-intellectual mediation and modulation of embodied emotions.95 By contrast, Zizek, for a number of EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł 173 ',\n",
       " 'Freudian-Lacanian reasons, insists that the emoting body, insinuated by sio to rest on a natural or instinctual basis, is altered right down to its bare bones and raw flesh by its trans formative insertion into the sociosymbolic matrices of the big Other. (First and foremost, the corporeal core self of Damasio is substantiated\" and \"denaturalized\" into the disembodied emptiness of Lac an\\'s Cogito-like $, a void linked to such linguistic signifier-entities as proper names and personal pronouns.)96 Zizek proceeds to refer to LeDoux, another major researcher in the field of affective neuroscience, best known for his empirical investigations of the role of the amygdala in generating fear, in extending his critique ofDamasio: It would be interesting to conceive the very specificity of \"being-human\" as grounded in this gap between cognitive and emotional abilities: a human being in whom emotions were to catch up with cognitive abilities would no longer be human, but a cold monster deprived of human emotions .... Here we should supplement LeDoux with a more structural approach: it is not ply that our emotions lag behind our cognitive abilities, stuck at the primitive animal level; this very gap itself functions as an \"emotional\" foct, giving rise to new, specifically human, emotions, from anxiety (as opposed to mere fear) to (human) love and melancholy. Is it that LeDoux (and Damasio, on whom LeDoux relies here) misses this feature because of the fundamental ness (or, rather, ambiguity) of the proto-Althusserian distinction between emotions and feelings? This distinction has a clear Pascalian twist (and it is a mystery that, in his extensive critique of \"Descartes\\' error,\" Damasio does not evoke Pascal, Descartes\\'s major critic): physical emotions do not display inner feelings but, on the contrary, generate them. However, there is thing missing here: a gap between emotions qua biological-organic bodily tures and emotions qua learned symbolic gestures following rules (like Pascal\\'s kneeling and praying). Specifically \"human\" emotions (like anxiety) arise only when a human animal loses its emotional mooring in biological instincts, and this loss is supplemented by the symbolically regulated emotions qua man\\'s \"second nature.\"97 Indeed, LeDoux, like Damasio, sees neuroscience and psychoanalysis as far from incompatible. Moreover, like the Lacanian Zizek, he emphasizes the reaching \"revolutionary\" (rather than just \"evolutionary; smooth, and gradual) ramifications for the human animal of its immersion in language, an sion changing and reshaping brains and bodies.98 (Damasio similarly speaks 174 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

From a psychoanalytic perspective, perhaps one of the most important facts emphasized by LeDoux is that, as it might be expressed, the brain, although a bodily organ, is not organic in such a way that it is a piece of nature that is a harmonious and synthesized self-integrated system of balanced components in sync with each other.IOl In fact, LeDoux points to precisely the sort of nomena that led Freud to posit the centrality in mental life of intrapsychical conflicts and Lacan to invoke again and again the figure of the split subject as evidence of the brain\\'s hodgepodge, collage-like construction, a tion whose mismatched elements don\\'t necessarily work well together.102 Along these lines, in his study The Emotional Brain, he observes: \"Although we often talk about the brain as if it has a function, the brain itself actually has no tion. It is a collection of systems, sometimes called modules, each with different functions. There is no equation by which the combination of functions of all the different systems mixed together equals an additional function called brain function.\"103 He goes on to add, \"Evolution tends to act on the individual ules and their functions rather than the brain as a whole .... [BJy and large most evolutionary changes in the brain take place at the level of individual ules.\"104 The brain, like the rest of the human body with which it\\'s inseparably enmeshed, is a product not of Evolution with a capital E (itself yet another nonexistent Lacanian big Other), but of a plethora of different and distinct evolutionary circumstances and challenges spread out over a disparate number of times and places (as Damasio puts it, \"Evolution is not the Great Chain of Being\").IOS In this vein, Alain Badiou\\'s denial of Nature as a monolithic cosmic One-All and parallel corresponding affirmation of the existence of a tion of natural multiplicities-\"Nature has no sayable being. There are only some natural beings:\\'106-can and should be applied to the natural-scientific notion of evolution. Moreover, these evolutionary pressures, not at all dinated and unified with each other, act separately on a diverse array of pendent systems and subsystems within the central nervous system. (Damasio notes that \"the brain is a system of systems\"!07 and highlights the mismatch between brain stem and cortex in the human nervous system, two [sub J systems of different evolutionary age forced to cooperate with each other.)!08 No down design plan governed the assembly process producing the peculiar lump EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł 17 S ',\n",

Consequently, the resulting product of such a process is, not ingly, prone to an incalculable number of internal antagonisms, tensions, and short circuits. Or, as the neuroscientist David]. Linden describes it, the human central nervous system is a \"kludge\": \"The brain is ... a kludge, ... a design that is inefficient, inelegant, and unfathomable, but that nevertheless works\" 109 and \"at every turn, brain design has been a kludge, a workaround, a jumble, a pastiche:\\'llo Linden\\'s book 1he Accidental Mind, published in 2007, edly insists that the brain is inelegantly designed by a multitude of haphazard evolutionary tinkerings in which the newer is plopped on top of the tively older and, hence, is \"poorly organized;\\' \"a cobbled-together mess.\"lll (Incidentally, Linden devastatingly wields his kludge thesis against tion proponents of so-called intelligent design.)ll2 In the year immediately after the publication of Linden\\'s book, the psychologist Gary Marcus, in the book Kludge, analyzed a range of mental phenomena in light of the same basic thesis advanced by Linden.ll3 Both Linden\\'s and Marcus\\'s positions are foreshadowed by, among other sources, Jacob\\'s Science article \"Evolution and kering\" from 1977114 (a quotation from which serves as one of the epigraphs to Marcus\\'s book). One would have to be, as it were, utterly brainless not to see the importance of this neuroscientific picture of the material seat of ity for a psychoanalytic metapsychology \\nemphasizing the central structuring functions of conflicts in mental life. Clearly consistent with his stress upon the nonexistence of the Brain with a capital B as \"brain function\" in the singular-echoing Badiou, there is, within each human being, no Brain, only some brains-is LeDoux\\'s repeated and emphatic argument against the false impression that affective neuroscience can and does deal with emotional life in general or an ultimately homogenous tion function in the brain (such as the so-called limbic system, something the objective reality of which is a bone of contention among neuroscientists),us So, not only is there no coherent brain function overall, but there is no emotion function overall either (and, with reference again to the trinity of cognition, emotion, and motivation, one might wonder, under the influence of alytic thinking, whether the same might be said for cognitive and motivational functions too). In his substantial survey Affictive Neuroscience, Panksepp takes a further step along this same trajectory delineated by LeDoux (even though he and LeDoux disagree about the status of the notion of the limbic system),u6 Panksepp maintains that even particular individual emotions lack discrete 176 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

For this reason, modern neuroscientists talk about interacting \\'circuits: \\'networks: and \\'cell assemblies\\' rather than \\'centers.\"\\'117 Combining LeDoux\\'s denial of a basic, general emotion function in the brain with Panksepp\\'s denial of compartmentalized anatomical brain loci related in a one-to-one manner with various feeling states, one can postulate the following: even specific singular emotions are complex (or complexes), that is, nonatomic or nonelementary clusters of interconnections between multiple different systems and subsystems in the brain. What\\'s more, it seems quite reasonable to suppose that all three dimensions of brain functioning (i.e., cognition, emotion, and motivation) come into play in affective phenomena. Panksepp says as much here. Moreover, elsewhere, he remarks that \"it must be kept in mind that the brain is a massively interconnected organ whose every part can find an access pathway to any other part.\"118 He subsequently links this fact to emotional phenomena, emphasizing that the brain\\'s mind-bogglingly intricate internal interconnectedness makes it such that emotions are cably intertwined with nonemotional dimensionsY9 Additionally, both within and between these interacting functions, it also seems defensible to esize that a plurality of separate strata of temporal layers deposited in the brain (deposits dating from natural-evolutionary times as well as nonnatural cal times) converge and clash throughout the neural interactions generating emotions, feelings, and the like. The big picture that arises from all of this, if indeed such a picture can be drawn on the basis of the preceding, is one that LeDoux appears to endorse. This endorsement is expressed in a passage that ZiZek undoubtedly has in mind when critically \"supplementing\" LeDoux\\'s ideas in The Parallax View: \"there is an imperfect set of connections between cognitive and emotional systems in the current stage of evolution of the human brain. This state of affairs is part of the price we pay for having newly evolved cognitive capacities that are not yet fully integrated into our brains. Although this is also a problem for other primates, it is particularly acute for humans, since the brain of our species, especially our cortex, was extensively rewired in the process of ing natural language functions.\"120 Zizek\\'s earlier-quoted comments on this EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł 177 ',\n",

Especially for a Lacanian, this lack (here a lack of coordination, harmonization, synthesis, and so on between different neurological functions) is positive as well as negative, a plus arising from a minus. And, like Lacan, LeDoux too identifies the cutting tion of language as largely responsible for the severity of the cracks and sures of desynchronization introduced into the human brain. Hence, Zizek, in consonance with a number of hypotheses recently put forward by various investigators into the brain,l2l speculates that in losing a presupposed prior lutionarily integrated balance of neurological functions, people gain their very humanness, their denaturalized subjectivity with its peculiar, uniquely human affective potentials. After formulating these observations in response to Damasio and LeDoux, Zizek proceeds to warn that one must mind \"the gap that separates the brain sciences\\' unconscious from the Freudian Unconscious.\"l22 He argues that this gap is particularly palpable as regards the topic of emotions.123 Other authors, such as Ansermet and Magistretti as well as Pommier, likewise caution against conflating the psychoanalytic unconscious with the unconscious often \\nspoken of by those situated in the neurosciences, with the latter frequently referring to what analysis would identify as merely preconscious or nonconscious (rather than unconscious proper in the sense of being defensively occluded by such intrapsychical mechanisms as repression, disavowal, negation, rejection or foreclosure, and so on)p4 Interestingly, LeDoux himself issues the exact same warning: \"Like Freud before them, cognitive scientists reject the view handed down from Descartes that mind and consciousness are the same. However, the cognitive unconscious is not the same as the Freudian or dynamic unconscious. The term cognitive unconscious merely implies that a lot of what the mind does goes on outside; of consciousness, whereas the dynamic unconscious is a darker, more malevolent place where emotionally charged memories are shipped to do mental dirty work. To some extent, the dynamic unconscious can be conceived in terms of cognitive processes, but the term cognitive unconscious does not imply these dynamic operations:\\'l25 Damasio too is aware of and acknowledges these crucial differences.l26 Zizek and certain other psychoanalytically inclined interpreters of the neurosciences are quite justified in being concerned that many neuroscientists carelessly and indefensibly conflate Freud\\'s unconscious with that of nonanalytic cognitive 178 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'science. H,-\"\",Ou?\\',. Damasio and the two neuroscientists mentioned name in the section of The View under consideration in the present context, are notable exceptions to this tendency in the neuroscientific ture. What\\'s more, although Zizek charges that Damasio problematically treats emotions (as distinct from feelings) as simply and straightforwardly natural in the sense of biologically hardwired-in his theory of the emotion-based self, Damasio indeed tends to speculate about a kernel of nature as the fixed tion for additional later layers of higher-order nurture 127 -there are moments when Damasio appears to entertain the possibility of sociosymbolic mediation penetrating all the way down into the bedrock of even the most rudimentary bodily emotional ground of human being.128 The issue of neuroscientific naturalism (such as Damasio\\'s, which is critiqued by Zizek) and its validity or invalidity vis-a-vis psychoanalysis will be returned to shortly. For the moment, four lines of thought in Damasio\\'s defense apropos his alleged failure to account for the properly Freudian unconscious ought to be advanced. First, if the conclusions reached by my prior reexamination of the treatments of affective phenomena in Freud are correct, then the mutually exclusive contrast Zizek appeals to between an emotional unconscious and the Freudian unconscious is questionable, if not incorrect (for the same reasons that render problematic Lacan\\'s dogmatic insistence that Freud flatly denies the existence of unconscious affects, an insistence upon which Zizek, at least in The Parallax View, evidently relies). Second, despite his general, prevailing emphasis upon the naturalness of the rudimentary emotional building blocks of the embodied human mind, Damasio (as I already have indicated) less occasionally allows for the possibility of cognitive (and, hence, linguistic) mediation and modulation even of physiological emotions, not just of psychologically parsed feelings. Third, Damasio\\'s distinction between emotions and feelings, rather than threatening to reduce the unconscious to a roiling carnal sea of primitive impulses and passions (in a fashion counter to Freudian-Lacanian psychoanalysis), both dovetails with key features of Lac an\\'s depiction of the unconscious and opens up new options for envisioning this set of mental dimensions central to psychoanalytic concerns. As regards this third line of defense, Lacan continually combats the crude popular image of the unconscious as a dark, hidden depth, repeatedly taining (sometimes with recourse to topology, the mathematical science of surfaces) that the unconscious is, so to speak, profoundly superficial, situated right out in the open of the signifiers and structures within which subjects come to be and circulate.129 Although Damasio, with respect to the topic of EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LAC AN Ł 179 ',\n",
       " 'the unconscious, indeed often does focus on emotions as deep corporeal states of a naturally shaped body overlooked by conscious mental attention (i.e., as unfelt emotions), his distinction between emotions and feelings nonetheless implies a notion of the unconscious that is anything but complicit with the woefully unsophisticated picture thinking of old versions of depth ogy. The Damasian unconscious consists not so much of unfelt emotions bubbling away in the obscure, opaque depths of the flesh, but instead of the ensemble of intervening mechanisms and processes facilitating and ing with the connections between emotions and feelings. In other words, Damasio\\'s unconscious, like that of Lacan, is a thin, in-between function of gaps, the cause of discrepancies and splits between manifest features of the parletre. In this vein, it\\'s important to recall that Damasio portrays emotions as public rather than private phenomena.l3O That is to say, emotional states, as corporeal events, are observable, at least in principle, by third parties, whether these third parties be scientists monitoring physiological changes in a human organism or nonscientific others taking stock of visible alterations expressed in and through the observed body of the person under consideration. (This is by contrast with feelings as mental events that, due to their first-person quality and corresponding experiential inaccessibility to other minds, can be \"observed\" only indirectly through linguistically conveyed reports.) So, an emotion a la Damasio, even if unfelt by the person whose body undergoes (un)said emotion, isn\\'t associated by him with concealed depths. the contrary: A Damasian emotion tends to be just as \"out there\" in the light of publicly visible day as the utterances spoken by the speaking subject. Along related lines, the Damasian unconscious subsists in the intervals between two types of manifestations: emotions as bodily conditions and thoughts as mental contents (which are potentially expressible in sociosymbolic terms, if not actually thus expressed). Thanks to these intervals as gaps between fested emotions and their equally manifested translations, nontranslations, or mistranslations in ideationally inflected mediums-such intervals should be counted as constituting some of the \"bars\" barring the split subject ($) of Lacanian theory-emotions can be not only unfelt but also misfelt in any number of manners. The fourth line of defense in favor of Damasio when faced with Zizek\\'s criticisms requires circumnavigating back to the question of naturalism versus antinaturalism. The position I\\'m staking out here in response to this tion could be succinctly encapsulated in Zizekian style as \"Naturalism or naturalism? No, thanks-both are worse!\"l31 Zizek closes the section of the ISO. MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'fourth chapter of The View dealing with Damasio, a section entitled \"Emotions or, Where Damasio Is \\\\Vrong,\" by insisting that we should bear in mind the basic anti-Darwinian lesson of psychoanalysis repeatedly emphasized by Lacan: man\\'s radical and fundamental tation, mal-adaptation, to his environs. At its most radical, \"being-human\" consists in an \"uncoupling\" from immersion in one\\'s environs, in following a certain automatism which ignores the demands of adaptation-this is what the \"death drive\" ultimately amounts to. Psychoanalysis is not \"deterministic\" (\"What I do is determined by unconscious processes\"): the \"death drive\" as a self-sabotaging structure represents the minimum of freedom, of a ior uncoupled from the utilitarian-survivalist attitude. The \"death drive\" means that the organism is no longer fully determined by its environs, that it \"explodeslimplodes\" into a cycle of autonomous behavior.132 The invocation of the psychoanalytic notion of the death drive won\\'t be treated in detail here; I\\'ve addressed Zizek\\'s philosophical appropriation of the infamous Freudian Todestrieb at length elsewhere.133 What I will address at present are the ways in which Zizek contrasts Damasio\\'s naturalism with Lacan\\'s antinaturalism. Both in the passage just quoted and others from the same portion of The Parallax View, one could read Zitek\\'s remarks as referring to a partial, rather than a complete, denaturalization tic of human beings qua subjects (as indicated by the adverb \"fully\" in \"the organism is no longer fully determined by its environs\"). Interpreted in this manner, Zitek succeeds at resisting the temptation of an exaggerated Lacanian antinaturalism insofar as he presupposes that the primitive tions deposited within the base of humans\\' mammalian brains by archaic evolutionary conditions persist alongside sociosymbolic configurations and all the various subjectifying mediations they bring with them. Zizek\\'s move here gestures at the notion of humans being creatures of incomplete, petually unfinished transformations, monstrous abortions of the failed lations of a weak, anything-but-omnipotent dialectic incapable of digesting the animal bodies out of which it emerges without leaving behind remaining residual scraps. To resort to the lexicon of Marxism, this would be a dialectic of interminably \"uneven development.\" However, one also, perhaps less charitably, could construe Zizek as sioning a total and thorough denaturalization befalling those living entities transubstantiated into $s by being taken up into the networks and webs of EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł 181 ',\n",

In an essay entitled \"From objet a to Subtraction:\\' he indeed sounds as though he endorses an excessively extreme antinaturalism, esizing a denaturalization without remainder that is brought about by the cesses of subjectification affecting human beings (as he similarly sounds in the previously mentioned discussion of life 1.0 versus life 2.0 from In Definse of Lost Causes). In that essay, Zizek depicts \"Freud\\'s basic lesson\" as the idea that \"there is no \\'human animal: a human being is from its birth (and even before) torn out of the animal constraints, its instincts are \\'denaturalized: caught in the circularity of the (death-)drive, functioning \\'beyond the pleasure principle.\\'\"134 Subsequently, in the same paragraph of this text, he suggests: \"In a step ther, one should even venture that there is no animal tout court, if by \\'animal\\' we mean a living being fully fitting its environs: the lesson of Darwinism is that every harmonious balance in the exchange between an organism and its environs is a temporary fragile one, that it can explode at any moment; such a notion of animality as the balance disturbed by the human hubris is a human fantasy.\" 13S Without contesting in the least the accuracy of this interpretation of winian evolutionary theory, it ought to be noticed that Zizek appears partially to denaturalize nonhuman animals typically considered to be elements of \"nature,\" which is imagined as a balanced harmony. (Zizek\\'s larger body of osophical work, especially in terms of his materialist ontology and ing theory of subjectivity, compels a radical rethinking of the protoconceptual pictures and metaphors constituting the images of nature informing standard varieties of naturalism.) 136 And although he partially denaturalizes nonhuman animals, he completely denaturalizes human animals, depicting such beings as always already \"torn out of\" their biological, instinctual animality. Although Damasio unambiguously evinces naturalist sympathies problematic from an orthodox Lacanian point of view, he and his like-minded brain researchers (such as LeDoux, Panksepp, and Keith Stanovich) don\\'t subscribe to any sort of essentialist naturalism that unreservedly reduces cultural nurture to natural nature, the more-than-biomaterial subject to the physiology of the biological body in and of itself In fact, in Damasio\\'s defense, his multitiered model of the embodied self avoids the trap of the false dichotomy pitting antinaturalism against naturalism as an either-or choice (again, in Leninist-Stalinist ogy, \"both are worse!\"). Sometimes Zizek himself elegantly navigates around this impasse. But, at select moments, he seems to force this false choice in elaborating his critical observations as regards, in particular, the neurosciences, evolutionary theory, and ecology. 182 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

A dis-or maladaptation as a sharp, absolute rupture with anything \"natural\" is, in a number of ways, far more adaptive than the partial and incomplete ralization that leaves humans stranded, as malformed Frankenstein-like jumbles of mismatched fragments thrown together over the course of unsynchronized sequences of aleatory events, halfway between nature and culture, between the lingering adaptations of evolutionary histories and those demanded by human histories past and present.137 Additionally, when surfacing within the context of contemporary sociocultural circumstances, previously \"adaptive\" behaviors conditioned by ancient evolutionary pressures can be much more maladaptive than the thoughts and actions of subjects steered by the sociocultural tors responsible for human disadaptation. Put differently, in the \"inverted world\" of human reality, dis-or maladaptation can be more adaptive than adaptation itself. Related to this, the conflictuality of overriding interest to psychoanalysis (i.e., those conflicts analytic metapsychology portrays as tense fissures central to the structuration of psychical subjectivity) almost certainly includes flicts between evolutionary nature (associated with adaptation) and tionaryantinature (associated with dis-or maladaptation) as well as conflicts EMOTIONAL LIFE AFTER LACAN Ł 183 ',\n",

       " \"AFFECTS ARE SIGNIFIERS THE INFINITE JUDGMENT OF A LACANIAN AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE Before turning to the task of elaborating a Freudian-Lacanian approach to the science of the emotional brain, a few general, preliminary remarks are in order. An irony acutely painful to partisans of analysis is that, over the course of the past several decades, Freud repeatedly has been pronounced dead and buried right at the moment when the life sciences are coming to confirm many of his core discoveries and insights, a moment of scientific vindication he anticipates starting with his earliest (proto analytic writings.! The time of Freud's apparent defeat is precisely the time of his actual triumph. A little over a century ago, in the context of century Europe, Freud was forced to argue fiercely against a deeply entrenched, widespread tendency to equate the mental with the conscious, a tendency responsible for some of the resistance to his central, fundamental ur-concept of the unconscious. Today, the assertion that not all of mental life is conscious is uncontroversial: every branch of nonpsychoanalytic psychology and science accepts as an empirically well-established truth the fact that the vast majority of mental life transpires below the threshold of explicit conscious awareness.2 Nobody nowadays bickers about whether significant portions of the cognitive, emotional, and motivational processes of the brain or mind unfold in nonconscious ways. A number of eminent figures in the ences have no problem whatsoever with acknowledging the existence of the psychoanalytic unconscious as a crucial, influential subsector of the broader \",\n",
       " 'category of the nonconscious. Additionally, there is an observation that ought to alleviate a typical Freudian-Lacanian worry aroused whenever anything ing to do with the physical sciences is put forward as potentially relevant to psychoanalysis: contemporary neuroscientific research is far from pointing in the direction of a vulgar mechanistic materialism crudely reducing nurture to nature, the more than biological to pure biology alone. If anything, the rosciences arguably are generating out of themselves a spontaneous cal materialism of a nonreductive sort in which the concepts and distinctions underpinning debates between already recognized varieties of naturalism and antinaturalism are being subverted and sublated in various fashions yet to be adequatelyappteciated.3 Reassuming a more precise angle of focus, Panksepp\\'s Affective ence, a comprehensive overview of research into the emotional dimensions of both human and animal brains, provides a number of points of departure for the endeavor to entwine together the neurosciences, Freudian-Lacanian choanalysis, and the specific metapsychological perspectives on affective life outlined previously here. The fact that Panksepp refuses to limit his discussion of the emotional brain to human brains alone is based on his conviction that likely would ruffle more than a few Lacanian feathers: He insists that human and nonhuman mammals in particular share a great deal in common in terms of basic brain structures and functions, including emotional configurations and dynamics at various neural levels (especially at the most primitive levels of evolutionarily conserved neuroanatomy).4 Panksepp hypothesizes that tion has wired into the archaic base of the mammalian central nervous system a fixed set of seven rudimentary, elementary emotions and corresponding riential tonalities. His taxonomy of the \"major \\'Blue-Ribbon, Grade A: tional systems of the mammalian brain\"s identifies four such systems, which are labeled \"SEEKING\" (stimulus-bound appetitive behavior and tion), \"PANIC\" (stimulus-bound distress vocalization and social attachment), \"RAGE\" (stimulus-bound biting and affective attack), and \"FEAR\" bound flight and escape behaviors).6 Plus, there are, in mammals particularly, three additional systems, .which are labeled \"LUST,\" \"CARE; and These seven emotions and their accompanying tones of feeling are depicted as the primary colors of mammals\\' multihued affective lives.8 (Solms and his coauthor Oliver Turnbull, in their sizable manifesto for a non-Lacanian psychoanalysis The Brain and the Inner World, adopt Panksepp\\'s hypothesis concerning \"basic emotions\").9 Panksepp maintains that human beings are just as moved as nonhuman mammals by this set of foundational emotional 186 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'elements. In this vein, Damasio, a similar emotional of affective phenomena, observes that the brain sculpted evolution certainly looks as though it\\'s much more prone to pain over pleasure: \"1here seem to be far more varieties of negative than positive emotions:\\'10 It would not be inappropriate to call to mind, in association with this, the factual detail that the early Freud, in The Interpretation o/Dreams, originally christened the fundamental law of psychical life the \"un pleasure principle\" (later to be ignated with the more familiar phrase \"pleasure principle\") so as to size the avoidance of pain and suffering as the primary tendency of the psyche (instead of emphasizing the \"positive\" side of this principle, that is, the dency to pursue ecstasy, gratification, joy, satisfaction, and so on)Y LeDoux, in his treatment of affective neuroscience, similarly proposes that \"brain evolution is basically conservative.\"12 LeDoux, like Panksepp, sees human affective life as resting on a base, shared with other mammals, of primitive tional reactions and repertoires installed by ancient, long-gone evolutionary contexts and challenges. It should be noted once more that the \"conservative\" lingering-on of out-of-date neural machinery and programs is precisely part of what produces some of the tensions characteristic \\nof the peculiarities ing the unique \"human condition\" of such concern to psychoanalysis. As was stated in the earlier critical assessment ofZizek\\'s reading of Damasio (in chapter 12), it would be mistaken to respond to the neuroscientific account of the tence of evolutionarily archaic emotional systems hardwired into humans\\' brains with an antinaturalism, Lacanian or otherwise, which goes so far as to deny (at this juncture, quite untenably, not only theoretically but also empirically) that speaking subjects, thanks to the \"castrating\" intervention of symbolic orders, retain any significant links with their material or physical bodies as analyzed specifically by the natural sciences. (This response, often voiced by Lacanians and like-minded theorists, posits an always-already complete denaturalization as essential to the existence of subjectivity proper.) As partial rather than complete, the denaturalization that befalls those submitted to sociosymbolic tion splits human subjects between, as it were, nature and antinature, failing fully to liquidate the former retroactively and without remainder; the antagonisms and discrepancies between natural and antinatural residues embedded as strata and currents uneasily cohabitating within the psychical apparatus contribute to the splitting (Spaltung) central to the barred subject ($). Moreover, despite the understandable insistence of Panksepp and LeDoux on the reality of basic emotional systems in the brains of all mammals alike, neither of these researchers advance a naturalism according to which humans are nothing more than highly AFFECTS ARE SIGNIFIERS ',\n",

In light of my nascent version of neuro-psychoanalysis, LeDoux\\'s work on the brain is appealing for several reasons. Apart from generally being thetic to psychoanalysis insofar as he both admits the existence of the analytic unconscious and highlights the significant role oflanguage in the neuromental lives of human subjects, LeDoux claims again and again that, apropos tive phenomena, conscious awareness is the exception rather than the ruleY (Panksepp concurs,14 likewise asserting, \"Most of emotional processing, as of every other psychobehavioral process, is done at an unconscious level.\")15 And, in line with an established consensus in the neurosciences, LeDoux is adamant that a dialectic between genetic nature and epigenetic or nongenetic (with \"nongenetic\" encompassing behavioral and symbolic factors) nurture shapes emotional and other brain functions such that neither a simplistic biologism nor an equally unsophisticated social constructivism can offer remotely sible explanations for affects (and many other things) in human beings.16 (Eva Jablonka and Marion J. Lamb\\'s four-dimensional analysis of evolution, taking into consideration genetic, epigenetic, behavioral, and symbolic dimensions, provides perhaps the best evolutionary-theoretic complement to this scientific research and its resultsP These two authors contend that \"it is bad biology to think about the nervous system in isolation\"18 and that \"the aries between the social sciences and biology are being broken down. People are aware that neither social nor biological evolution can be studied in lation.\")19 The potentials of LeDoux\\'s neuroscientific delineations of human emotional life for a Freudian-Lacanian neuro-psychoanalytic metapsychology of affect are manifest in the closing pages of his book The Emotional Brain: \"Consciousness is neither the prerequisite to nor the same thing as the capacity to think and reason. An animal can solve lots of problems without being overtly conscious of what it is doing and why it is doing it. Obviously, consciousness elevates thinking to a new level, but it isn\\'t the same thing as thinking.\"20 After these statements echoing Freud\\'s century-old gesture of decoupling thinking from consciousness-the psychoanalytic unconscious involves forms of ing minus an accompanying reflexive self-awareness (i.e., \"1 think without thinking that 1 think\")-LeDoux proceeds to discuss affective phenomena: Emotional feelings result when we become consciously aware that an tion system of the brain is active.

The difFerence between fear, anxiety, terror, apprehension, and the like would not be possible without language. At the same time, none of these words would have any point if it were not for the existence of an underlying emotion system that generates the brain states and bodily expressions to which these words apply. Emotions evolved not as conscious feelings, linguistically differentiated or otherwise, but as brain states and bodily responses. The brain states and bodily responses are the fundamental facts of an emotion, and the conscious feelings are the frills that have added icing to the emotional cake.21 According to LeDoux\\'s dialectical model, the initial impetus and oomph lying affective life originates with and arises from evolutionarily primal and primary corporeal emotions of a fundamental and foundational nature (i.e., the emotions identified by Panksepp in his seven-category taxonomy). ever, in the exceptional animals that are human beings as parletres, the getic, vital flows of these old mammalian juices run smack into language, being channeled through the mediating networks of the linguistic-representational structures constitutive of speaking subjectivities. Such structures then come to exert a reciprocal counterinfluence on these archaic influences, refracting, for instance, the effects of the FEAR and PANIC systems into a much more fine-grained spectrum offeelings (i.e., \"fear, anxiety, terror, apprehension, and the like\": Damasio, in Descartes\\' Error, similarly distinguishes between mary emotions\" and \"secondary emotions\").22 But, a pressing question must be posed at this juncture: do these thus refracted feelings react back on their emotional bases, dialectically transforming their corporeal causes or sources, and, if so, to what extent? Despite elsewhere indicating that he indeed would at least admit and tain the possibility of linguistic-representational nurture reflexively altering embodied emotional nature in a thoroughly dialectical fashion, LeDoux, at the very end of the last block quotation in the previous paragraph, seems to risk regressing back to a nondialectical position according to which alterations to affective life wrought by the nonnatural or not-entirely-natural sions determinative of humanity\\'s distinguishing peculiarities are reduced to an ineffectual secondary status as mere window dressing arrayed around the fringes of a fixed, unchanged biomaterial ground (\"the conscious feelings are the frills that have added icing to the emotional cake\").

       " 'chapter IS Two are this moment in LeDoux\\'s reflections represents a naturalist within even the most nonreductive neuroscientific materialisms (that of not only LeDoux but also Damasio )23 that warrant the Lacan-inspired criticisms Zizek levels against Damasio and LeDoux (the prior defense of these latter two relies on other moments in their writings when they steer clear of nondialectical . reductivism). Second, this same moment in the concluding pages of The tional Brain overlooks something The Parallax View rightly and insightfully highlights, namely, that the gap between the biological and the biological comes to function as itself an affective factor, rather than affective phenomena falling exclusively on one side or the other of this gap (i.e., as either emotions of a biological nature or feelings of a more-than-biological nurture). Maybe what makes an affect a specifically human experience (as distinct from the bodily emotions and psychological feelings evidently also undergone by nonhuman sentient mammals) is its bearing witness to humanity\\'s status as stranded in an ontological limbo between nature and anti nature, torn between split planes of existence irrupting out of the immanence of a self-sundering material Real. 24 Returning to more empirical terrain and examining Panksepp\\'s work in greater depth promises to be fruitful. Several times, he stresses that tieity holds for emotional systems as much as for other components of human neuroanatomy.25 In relation to this, he (like both Damasio and LeDoux) grants that cognitive mediations and modulations, involving complex symbolic and linguistic representational constellations, play significant roles in coloring and inflecting affective phenomena in human life;26 a two-way street of dialectical and reciprocal co-determination connects cognition and emotion for beings with highly developed cerebral cortices in addition to other, \"lower\" neural components left over from archaic evolutionary histories and shared with various other animal organisms.27 Panksepp goes so far as to argue, as regards humans, that \"one can never capture innate emotional dynamics in their pure form, except perhaps when they are aroused artificially by direct stimulation of brain areas where those operating systems are most concentrated.\"28 ing this argument later, he states: It is becoming increasingly clear that humans have as many instinctual ing systems in their brains as other mammals. However, in mature humans such instinctual processes may be difficult to observe because they are no ger expressed directly in adult behavior but instead are filtered and modified 190 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'by higher cognitive activity. Thus, in adult humans, many instincts manifest \\nthemselves only as subtle psychological tendencies, such as subjective feeling states, which provide internal guidance to behavior. The reason many scholars who know little about modern brain research are still willing to assert that human behavior is not controlled by instinctual processes is because many of our operating systems are in fact very \"open\" and hence very prone to be modified by the vast layers of cognitive and affective complexity that learning permits. Still, the failure of psychology to deal effectively with the nature of the many instinctual systems of human and animal brains remains one of the great failings of the discipline. The converse could be said for neuroscience.29 A number of comments are called for \\nhere. To begin with, in the second half of this quotation, Panksepp accurately and succinctly diagnoses the parallel comings of \"psychology\" (as associated with nurture-centric constructivism) and \"neuroscience\" (as associated with nature-centric biologism) with respect to the (partially obsolete) debate between naturalism and antinaturalism. In Panksepp\\'s view, the plasticity of the human central nervous system, a plasticity affecting its emotional structures and dynamics, consists of the intertwining of inflexible \"closed\" and flexible \"open\" neural systems (i.e., on the one hand, those systems rigidly wired by genetics to produce relatively invariant patterns of cognition and comportment, and, on the other hand, those systems fluidly wired to be rewired by epigenetic or nongenetic accidents, contingencies, ables, and so on).30 In response to Panksepp, someone with Hegelian or psychoanalytic leanings might be inclined to retort that the purportedly epistemological ity of brute, raw instinctual emotions is not strictly and solely epistemological. Shouldn\\'t Panksepp\\'s spontaneous Kantianism, in which \"pure\" instinctual emotions are treated as thinkable-yet-unknowable noumenal selves that exist beyond the epistemologically accessible affective phenomena \"filtered and modified by higher cognitive activity:\\' be met with a ism speculating that this ostensible epistemological inaccessibility already directly discloses the \"Thing itself.\" the ontological Real supposedly barred by subjective reflection? In other words, certain versions of Hegelian phy and Freudian-Lacanian psychoanalytic metapsychology would insist that the general absence of brute, raw instinctual emotions in the manifestations of specifically human existence is a testament to the thoroughgoing cal digestion of the natural by the more-than-natural, rather than a reflection of a noumenal-phenomenal split between these two dimensions depicted as AFFECTS ARE SIGNIFIERS Ł 191 ',\n",
       " 'separate and distinct realms of a two-tiered one inaccessible (i.e., the natural or the other accessible (i.e., the than-natural/biological). Pommier, whose Lacanian glosses on the ences I will address in more detail later, appears to adopt a stance along these lines, maintaining that \"once the entry into speech has been accomplished, \\'pure sensation\\' becomes that from which we exile ourselves.\"3l He adds that conceding this necessitates abandoning the \"myth of an original paradise, that of our improbable animality.\"32 Of course, to be perfectly honest and exact, portraying Panksepp as a taneous Kantian treating basic emotions (i.e., his seven \"primary colors\" of mammalian affective life) as akin to the notorious Ding an sich is far from fair. His denial of epistemological access to these emotional fundaments is not without qualification (in contrast with Kant\\'s unqualified denial of access to the noumenal realm lying forever beyond \"the limits of possible experience\"). Panksepp posits that there are exceptional circumstances in which these primal constituents of human bodily being come to light in their undiluted diacy. However, he stresses the artificiality of these circumstances; in addition to the experimental tools and techniques of the laboratory that he has in mind, one might also imagine, taking into account psychoanalytic and sociopolitical considerations, brutal ordeals and overwhelming traumas as excessive \"limit experiences\" violently unleashing unprocessed corporeal intensities pitilessly reducing those who suffer these experiences to the dehumanized state of naked animality, of convulsing, writhing flesh. This precise qualification noted by Panksepp signals an inversion that itself arguably is constitutive of the human condition: the reversal of the respective positions or roles of, so to speak, first and second natures (or Zizek\\'s life 1.0 and life 2.0), a reversal in which the ondary becomes the primary and vice versa. Such an inversion can be clarified further through reference to Giorgio Agamben\\'s Homo Sacer. Therein, Agamben examines the distinction, rooted in the language of ancient Greece, between \"zoe, which expressed the simple fact of living common to aU living beings (animals, men, or gods), and bios, which indicated the form or way of living proper to an individual or a group.\"33 Without getting bogged down in what would be, in the present context, a gential exegesis of Agamben\\'s genealogy of the distinction between zoe and bios in relation to structures of political sovereignty (a genealogy inspired by both Nietzsche and Foucault and particularly indebted to the latter\\'s concept of\"biopower\"),34 it suffices for now to draw attention to his contention that, in the always-already established individual and group forms or ways of life into 192 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

On the contrary, the very possibility of distinguishing life and law, anomie and nomos, coincides with their tion in the biopolitical machine. Bare life is a product of the machine and not something that preexists it.\"36 In other words, in tandem with his rejection of standard, traditional \"state of nature\" narratives about humanity\\'s transition from pre-sociohistorical zoe red in tooth and nail to the sociohistorical bios of the polis as established on the basis of a \"social contrace\\'37 Agamben proposes that humans are, at a default level, beings of bios (i.e., life organized and lished by more-than-biologicallanguages, institutions, practices, and so on) rather than creatures of zoe. Put differently, although the bare life that is zoe often is imagined as a first nature ontogenetically and phylogenetically ing bios as the second nature of a nonbare life clothed by the artificial tions of language, society, and history, Agamben\\'s remarks correctly point out that exceptional \"artificial\" means (for him, the means being actions taken by established sovereign power with respect to the subject-bodies it rules over) are necessary to strip away the default second-nature-become-first-nature that is bios. In the inverted world of human life, zoe is correspondingly a become-secondary, an exception to the rule of bios that appears, in nian parlance, exclusively in legal-political \"states of exception\" enacted in the names of unusual circumstances and alleged crises.38 To circumnavigate back to Panksepp and neuroscientific matters, a bination of Agamben\\'s handling of the zoe-bios distinction with my position which is neither naturalist nor antinaturalist, a position centered on a esized failed dialectic of incomplete denaturalization that is constitutive of human forms of subjectivity, enables the following to be said apropos a influenced neuro-psychoanalytic metapsychology of affect: In human beings, the zoe of bare emotional life-this life doesn\\'t disappear with the advent of the bios of feelings and the array of their accompanying conditions of bility, but is only partially eclipsed and absorbed by the mediating matrices giving shape to bios-is fractured, like Damasio\\'s core self, into unsublated brute, raw basic emotions (which manifest themselves solely in rare, extreme conditions) and sublated feelings as sociosymbolically translated emotions (or even, following Zizek, as affective states aroused by the gap between tions and feelings).

The \"updates\" don\\'t erase entirely the earlier versions, with bugs, glitches, and loopholes being generated by the unsynthesized layering of these materialized temporal-historical strata. Panksepp is careful to stipulate that, despite their interpenetrating mutual entanglements, cognitive and emotional aspects of the human central vous system nonetheless remain somewhat distinct and distinguishable.39 One shouldn\\'t sloppily lump them together into a muddy mess through an gantly quick-and-easy pseudo dialectical approach that simply blurs the lines of conceptual demarcations in its haste to unite with what is imagined to be ity\\'s subtle shades of grey. For Panksepp, the differences between cognition and emotion are at least as important to keep in view as the fact of their reciprocal, entwined relatedness insofar as these differences are the sites of palpable tion between conflicting components and tendencies of subjects\\' incompletely integrated, hodgepodge brains. He claims that, although the affective lives of human beings are substantially inflected by cognitive (i.e., cultural, ideational, linguistic, representational, social, symbolic, and so on) mediations, the pelling, gripping, potent pulsations of emotional phenomena issue forth from a comparatively ancient, primitive neural base.40 Furthermore, he maintains that an imbalance obtains between cognition and emotion as unequal partners in mental life: \"emotions and regulatory feelings have stronger effects on nitions than the other way around.\"41 In terms of the calibration constitutive of (neuro) plasticity between open flexibility and closed inflexibility, Panksepp stresses that a certain degree of genetic closure at the level of basic emotional systems (deposited in brains over the course of the old, slow-moving currents of evolutionary times) sets limiting boundaries for the bandwidths of possible epigenetic or nongenetic openness to denaturalizing alterations of affective spectrums (alterations unfolding at temporal rhythms and rates of tively much faster speeds than natural-qua-evolutionary times): \"the ability of the human cortex to think and to fantasize, and thereby to pursue many unique paths of human cultural evolution, can dilute, mold, modify, and focus the tates of these systems, but it cannot eliminate them.\"42 (Damasio argues for a similar perspective.)43 To segue into a space of overlap between the neurosciences and Lacanian metapsychology, not only is the human brain a concrete, biomaterial point of condensation for the only partially compatible temporal tracks of man evolutionary phylogeny and human sociohistorical phylogeny, but, as 194 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

As indicated in a much earlier sion (in chapter II), Lacan\\'s distinction between lalangue and la langue is quite relevant in the context of the current analysis. Pommier says something odd that sounds less strange once one appreciates select details of Lac an\\'s rich, tifaceted treatments oflanguage: \"neuroscientists forget ... speech, ... the port of which, far from being spiritual, is also material.\"44The oddness has to do with the fact that ample neuroscientific attention has been paid to \\nlanguage, at least in the Lacanian sense of la langue, which refers to the natural languages usually acquired by children and employed by linguistically competent bers of given groups of language users. Pommier\\'s insistence on the material dimension of \"speech\" (fa parole) is crucial here: when it comes to both the spoken and the written, Freudian-Lacanian psychoanalytic metapsychology is at least as concerned with materiality as with meaning. The primary cess mentation of lalangue, as a jouis-sens playing with phonemes and emes, flows through sounds and images in ways unconstrained by secondary process mentation\\'s concerns to obey the constraining rules of a language\\'s (as une langue) syntax and semantics so as to succeed at producing tively recognizable conventional significance. An analyst, in listening to an analysand\\'s speech, should be as attentive to the murmurings of meaningless lalangue as to the meaningful utterances of la langue spoken by the (self-) conscious speaker on the couch. When Lacan draws attention to the material signifier (as being different from the sign), this is part of what\\'s at stake at those moments.45 This is one of the two fundamental aspects oflanguage that mier sees the neurosciences overlooking (the other being the links between language and Otherness as understood in Lacanian theory, a topic to be taken up soon below). As regards lalangue as distinct from la langue, Changeux, who Pommier cites in beginning to weave a neuro-psychoanalytic perspective on language,46 indeed does touch upon infantile babbling in a neurological account of guage acquisition.47 One of Changeux\\'s key theses is his assertion that \"to learn is to eliminate.\"48 He hypothesizes that the developing brain learns numerous things of various sorts through playing \"cognitive games.\" These games involve the brain spontaneously generating \"pre-representations:\\' an activity that could be described as a process of actively fantasizing, imagining, or hallucinating at the surrounding world, creatively concocting \"hypotheses\" projected onto AFFECTS ARE SIGNIFIERS Ł 195 ',\n",

Through interactions with the environment, especially the social milieus oflanguage-using adult others, the infant is prompted to pare down the proliferating plethora of noises of its baby tongue (i.e., lalangue) so as to give voice to the narrower set of well-ordered phonemes recognized by the mother tongue (i.e., la langue) into which hel she is being inducted. (This is analogous to Kant\\'s account, in his Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View, of how the externally dictated discipline of education and tion transforms the excessive, unruly freedom of the human child as pre-or protorational into the tamed and domesticated autonomy of the adult nal subject.)5l In other words, early childhood language acquisition isn\\'t so much a matter of building up une langue; it\\'s more a matter of tearing down and eliminating (or, more accurately, attempting to eliminate) the nonsensical meanderings and ramblings of lalangue, of the cognitive games jouis-sens plays with the vocal apparatus. La langue is part of what remains of lalangue after the contextually imposed trimming and snipping of \"symbolic castration\" by the transsubjective Other and intersubjective others of the linguistic universes into which the child is inserted has been undergone. However, psychoanalysis especially divulges veritable mountains of evidence that, sheltering within the parletre of la langue, vestiges of lalangue continue to manifest themselves, ticularly in the forms familiar from the Freudian \"psychopathology of everyday life:\\' namely, dreams, jokes, parapraxes, slips of the tongue, and so on; the roscientific study oflanguage would do well to consider more thoroughly such evidence and phenomena. Apropos neurology, Changeux\\'s theory of learning reflects what LeDoux characterizes as the \"use it or lose it\" doctrine of neural \"selection ism:\\' ing to this doctrine, the initial \"exuberance\" of an infant\\'s neural there are more synaptic connections present in early stages of development than will be needed later by the more mature organism-is pruned down through \"subtraction:\\' through the exchanges between organism and ment determining which connections will be used (and, hence, will be kept) and which ones won\\'t be used (and, hence, will be allowed to atrophy or pletely wither away).52 Changeux describes this selectionist process as \"the epigenetic stabilization of common neural networks\"53 (i.e., a social dynamic 196 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",
       " 'mirror neurons in which the structures of the young child\\'s brain are sculpted through pruning to be more or less sufficiently similar, for purposes of linguistic acculturation, to his/her older fluent symbolic others).54 Pommier recapitulates everything summarized in the preceding graphs.55The Lacanian supplement he adds to the neuroscientific theories is an emphasis on the irreducible role ofintersubjective and transsubjective variables (i.e., Imaginary others and Symbolic Others) in the genesis of sociosymbolic subjectivity in the immature subject-to-be. Pommier adamantly maintains that spontaneous endogenous developments within the physiological systems of the nascent parletre don\\'t account for language acquisition and the cation it brings with it. That is to say, the eliminations and selections imposed on the child\\'s neural networks-these eliminations and selections are pruning processes through which the wild thickets of lalangue\\'s jouis-sens-laden blings (i.e., primary processes) are cut down (albeit, for psychoanalysis, not purged altogether without remainder) into the narrower confines of ably meaningful forms of une langue (i.e., secondary processes)-are imposed thanks to the interactive interventions of Significant (and signifying) others actively engaging with the child. For Pommier, \"the signification of sounds depends on a sense given by an exterior authority: it breaks with the organicist model of auto-organization.

Organicism cannot render an account of neuronal modeling, since the only efficacious sonorities are those that signify something for the Other.\"56 He quickly proceeds to link this with a more general theme emerging from the life sciences and philosophical pretations of them: the plastic human brain in particular is genetically destined to be turned over to shaping vicissitudes far from entirely governed by lutionary-genetic influences alone, and is naturally preprogrammed by ics to be nonnaturally reprogrammed by epigenetics or nongenetics; in short, hardwired to be rewired.57 As Pommier puts it regarding the Lacanian Other as the locus of epigenetic or nongenetic factors of a symbolico-linguistic sort, \"It is henceforth innate that it wouldn\\'t be innate\";58 or, as his fellow Lacanian neurosympathizers Ansermet and Magistretti articulate the same idea, it is \"as though, when all is said and done, the individual were to appear genetically determined not to be genetically determined.\"59 To make one last fast-and-loose reference to Zizek\\'s contrast between life 1.0 and life 2.0, an argument parallel to the one I laid out in chapter 12 apropos the layering oflife La and life 2.0 that is neither natural \\nnor anti natural (i.e., the AFFECTS ARE SIGNIFIERS Ł 197 ',\n",

Of course, such a claim is merely in good keeping with Freudian doxy insofar as psychoanalysis, despite certain widespread misunderstandings, isn\\'t a developmental psychology, at least not in any straightforward sense. More precisely, due to what Freud characterizes as the \"timelessness\" of the unconscious,60 prior phases of ontogenetic development (i.e., past periods of psychical experience and structure) are not expunged and replaced by quent phases of development. Instead, the effects of the passage of time on the psyche involve the cumulative sedimentation of interacting layers, rather than successive demolitions of the old by the new (this point being illustrated by Freud with that image of the city of Rome in which all of the strata of its torical development are preserved side by side, sandwiched together).61 But, what relevance does this have for a Freudian-Lacanian neuro-psychoanalysis of affective life?

Additionally, the affect-languages of the latter (i.e., the words and phrases of natural languages designating emotions and feelings) are notoriously ambiguous and vague. In fact, one of the most familiar ways in which people arrive at a palpable awareness of the limits guage is when they wrestle with the clumsy, clunky inadequacy of their mother tongue in trying to express linguistically the subtle nuances and fine-grained shades of fluid affective phenomena. The combination of affectively tial (yet consciously difficult-to-recognize) associations at the level of lalangue with the superimposed level of the inelegant affect-languages ofla langue makes for a confusing and dizzyingly disorienting intrapsychical and subjective cacophony of tongues, a multivoiced soliloquy that sometimes loudly clamors and sometimes softly murmurs. Consequently, knowing how, what, and why one feels what one feels can be nearly impossible in certain instances. With this in mind, it now will be productive to circumnavigate back to the neurosciences of the emotional brain. 198 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

From his perspective, the key problem here is one of constructing an accurate taxonomy of affects: how should primary and secondary emotions, various feeling states, and related phenomena be classified, and with what linguistic labels ?62 Panksepp directly evinces the concern that the affect-vocabularies of natural languages are too equivocal and imprecise to furnish affective neuroscience with concept-terms of sufficient clarity and distinctness to carve with rigorous representational cision the realities of the emotional brain at, as it were, its real joints. This is the exact juncture at which a proper Hegelian gesture with respect to Panksepp's neuroscience of affects is both possible and productive, a gesture mobilizing the interrelated life-scientific facts and notions of neuroplasticity and genetics.63 (It's no accident that Malabou's philosophically fruitful turn to the neurosciences was initially motivated by her sophisticated appreciation of the role of plasticity in Hegel's anthropology.)64The Hegel-style move to be made in this context is to assert that the difficulty of naming affective phenomena is not external to the thing itself. Worded differently, the ambiguities, vagueness, equivocations, and imprecision of the intermingled affect-languages of both lalangue and les langues don't remain neatly confined to a separate tational outside (say, scientific discourses supposedly apart from their objects of investigation) without effects on neurologically grounded emotional being. Or, put in yet other terms, the uncertainties Panksepp highlights that raise doubts about any taxonomy in affective neuroscience aren't just indicative of purely epistemological-representational inadequacies internal to scientific courses; these uncertainties reflect the uncertainties of affective life in and of itself, a life in which felt feelings circulate among a much vaster range of unfelt and misfelt feelings. This Hegelian gesture vis-a.-vis Panksepp is justified for a number of reasons, many of which I have formulated already. To begin with, neuroplasticity is now a well-established, undisputed matter of scientific fact. Part of what the side of plasticity involving flexibility and malleability entails is the brain's cally dictated openness to epigenetic or nongenetic dictates.6s In Lacanian eyes, symbolic orders constitute one of the most significant sources (if not the most significant source) of more-than-genetic factors influential in the vicissitudes of ontogenetic subject formation. The physiologically and psychologically momentous period of language acquisition is a time during which (in nese) lalangue is affected by la langue (an affecting for which neuroplasticity is one of the crucial material conditions of its very possibility that is contingent AFFECTS ARE SIGNIFIERS Ł 199 \",\n",

Obviously, one sizable tor of the language or languages thus identified with consists of vocabularies for affective phenomena. Once created on these bases and in these ways, the parletre, the speaking subject who speaks to him-/herself and others about, among other things, affective phenomena using arguably hazy and inexact affect-vocabularies, is autoaffecting, an autoaffection that both (re)acts on the neural foundations participating in its generation and is routed through the heteroaffective mediation of others and Others. Furthermore, it\\'s worth remembering at this point that the contemporary sciences of the brain emphasize the co-penetrating entanglements of the nitive and emotional systems of the massively interconnected human central nervous system (or, translated into Lacan\\'s terminology, signifiers and affects aren\\'t, in actuality if not in theory, cleanly partitioned and independent in tion to each other). This means that the cognitive dimension of affect-language gets woven into the emotional dimension of affects themselves, setting in motion an oscillating, back-and-forth dialectic of mutual, two-way modulation between affects and signifiers. (LeDoux draws attention to this in less cal terms.)67 Consequently, the reflexive autoaffective dynamics of the parletre qua $, dynamics in which the confusing muddiness of the emotional lexicons of overlapping lalangue and la langue swirls about, result in fuzzy and cise affect-vocabularies literally bedding down in the brain itsel£ sculpting and rewiring this groundless neural ground. Hence, Panksepp\\'s lack of Hegelian sensibilities when considering the linguistic naming and representation of emotions and feelings is an instructive example of what Pommier might mean when he accuses neuroscientists of \"forgetting\" the issue oflanguage larly language as understood in Lacanian psychoanalytic theory).68 This also lends illustrative support to Pommier\\'s contention that \"more and more of the numerous results of the neurosciences are illegible without psychoanalysis.\"69 A similar absence of Hegelian finesse afRicts the non-Lacanian choanalysis advocated by Solms. Alluding to both Spinoza and the American analytic philosopher of mind Donald Davidson, he and his collaborators claim \"dual-aspect monism\" to be the ontological framework through which their particular version of the synthesis of the neurosciences and psychoanalysis 1.00 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

These dangers and difficulties aside, Solms and Turnbull helpfully highlight a number of interesting sites of overlap between psychoanalysis and the sciences. In particular, they emphasize, in a resonation with earlier discussions, the various important roles of neurologically hardwired \"blanks\" in the human brain, namely, hardwired absences of hard wiring. Such preprogrammed ings, openings for reprogramming, are, in their view, crucial conditions for the potential eventual genesis of the forms of subjectivity familiar to quotidian experience generally and psychoanalytic clinical practice specifically. priating Panksepp\\'s taxonomy of the evolutionarily primary basic emotion systems shared between humans and other mammals, Solms and Turnbull associate the SEEKING system with the Freudian notion of the id-Ievel seat of the drives, that is, the motivational foundations of the libidinal economy. In so doing, they claim that Freud\\'s crucial thesis regarding the \"objectless\" status of the drives72 is vindicated by the neuroscientific discovery that the SEEKING system acquires its orienting coordinates (i.e., what exactly, in terms of objects and states of affairs, is craved, desired, wanted, and so on) exclusively over time through experience, learning, and so on.73 Apart from the SEEKING system, Solms and Turnbull, when addressing as a whole Panksepp\\'s overall taxonomic schema for the evolutionary foundations of the emotional brain, are anxious to underscore that adopting this schema isn\\'t tantamount to capitulating to a reductive naturalism or mechanistic rialism eliminating much of what a psychoanalytic approach would wish to conserve.

(Borrowing David Chalmers\\'s phrase,78 one could credit Green with tackling head-on the neuro-psychoanalytic version of the \"hard problem\" around which mind-body debates in Anglo-American lytic philosophy orbit.) Green touches on a number of claims and topics dealt with earlier here: the significant influence oflanguage as a higher-order tive function on the embodied psyche;79 the contextual mediation of the brain as dependent for its structures and dynamics on its particular physical and tural-symbolic environs;80 the inseparable entanglement of nature and nurture in human subjects, to the point of the difference often being indiscernible for all intents and purposes;81 the biologically inborn incompleteness of human beings as naturally destining humans to sociosexual denaturalization;82 the drive-level intersections at which soma and psyche are soldered to each other while nonetheless remaining relatively distinct from one another.83 For anyone acquainted with Lacan\\'s writings, the title of Green\\'s book is likely to call to mind the eerit \"Presentation on Psychical Causality\" (1946). Therein, Lacan speaks of \"the intersection of the biological and the social:\\'84 He proceeds to remark that \"man is far more than his body, even though he can know [sa voir ] nothing more about his being.\"85 Lest this remark be mistaken for marking an abrupt break with anything biological, Lacan, consonant with ous lines of his thought expressed elsewhere,86 hints a page later at the relevance 202 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

And yet, Green\\'s analytic \"materialism\" refuses to ground the psyche in the brain.95 Instead, with a nod to certain religious notions, he \"pleads for a \\'laicized\\' soul that we designate as such in order to oppose it to cerebral machinery, which is nothing but a pale caricature of that which is the psyche.\"96 He immediately warns one not to \"confound this psyche with the religious soul of a divine essence.\"97 And yet, he subsequently resumes flirting with religiosity, laying out a vision of psychoanalysis as raising the truth of religious antireductionism (as opposed to the purportedly reductive mechanistic materialism of the sciences, including the neurosciences) to the dignity of its secular, \\ndemystified Notion.98 However, in contrast with Green\\'s compromise position between religion and science, what if, reenacting the uncompromising Leninist stance of rialism and Empirio-Criticism (1908), one objects that this psyche qua ized soul really isn\\'t all that secular except for a scientific explanation of how AFFECTS ARE SIGNIFIERS Ł 203 ',\n",

Rather, this is to insist that any materialism worthy of the title must perform, in order to be truly materialist yet simultaneously nonreductive, a sort of theoretical jujitsu trick, namely, a vaguely Godelian-style in-or de completion of the ral sciences. A materialism entirely divorced from the natural sciences (i.e., a staunchly antinaturalist materialism) is materialist in name only; a ist (as opposed to idealist) antinaturalism requires a natural-scientific account of the material possibility conditions for the emergence of the antinatural (as more than natural or material).lOo Playing off an irreducible nonnatural subject, portrayed as a mystery utterly inexplicable in scientific terms, against the tional straw man caricature of a natural neuronal machine governed exclusively by the blind mechanisms of the efficient causalities of evolution and genetics merely reinstates a version of those dualisms that rightly are so anathema to the tradition of authentic (dialectical) materialism.101 When it comes to the subjects of concern to psychoanalysis (i.e., human beings as speaking subjects), the real challenge is to pinpoint and link up two parallel, complementary nodes of explanatory incompleteness within tific and psychoanalytic discourses. A properly formulated ysis does precisely this. It engages in the double move of (I) complementing Freudian-Lacanian psychoanalysis with a naturalist or biological account of the material underpinnings of denaturalized or more-than-biological jectivityand (2) complementing the neurosciences with a sophisticated, tematic metapsychological theory of subjects whose geneses, although tied to brains, involve much more than bare organic anatomy. (These emergent subjects also come to have significant repercussions for the biomaterial bases that are the necessary-but-not-sufficient aleatory conditions of possibility for their very existences.) One can and should strive to develop a scientifically shaped (although not purely and strictly scientific) account of how humans defying and escaping explanatory encapsulation by the sciences become what they are.102 Correlatively, a materialist psychoanalysis must be, as Lacan would put it, not without its scientific reasons, while maintaining itself as a specific discipline whose objects of inquiry cannot be absorbed unreservedly into jectless material being(s).103 I believe that psychoanalysis nowadays can make 204 Ł \\nMISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

As regards Green specifically, of even greater interest in connection with outlining a neuro-psychoanalytic metapsychology of affect is an early essay by him, \"The Logic of Lacan\\'s objet (a) and Freudian Theory: Convergences and written under the influence of Lac an and published in 1966 in the third issue of the journal Cahiers pour f Analyse. Therein, in a tion of his essay on \"The Problem of the Distinction Between the tative of Drive and the Affect,\" he addresses the relations between, on the one hand, Freud\\'s Vorstellung and Lacan\\'s signifier and, on the other hand, affective phenomena as distinct from such ideational representations and their logics or structures. Speaking of the later Freud, Green enigmatically proposes that \"the affict takes on the status of signifier.\" 104 (He reiterates this a few years later in Le discours vivant.)lOS To Lacanian ears, this sounds odd, to the point of perhaps sounding paradoxical or self-contradictory insofar as Lacan tirelessly insists on the difference in kind separating affects and nifiers. A few paragraphs later, Green seems to reinstate Lacan\\'s distinction between signifier and affect by claiming that the latter, unlike the former, is noncombinatory: \"The specificity of affict is that it cannot enter into tion.\"106 Unlike Lacan, the early Green, in line with Freud, allows for the sibility of affects succumbing to repression.107 But, in Green\\'s view, whereas repressed signifiers qua Vorstellungen come to light only through indirect, winding webs of associative combinations involving multiple ideational resentations of the same type, repressed affects \"can be expressed that is, without passing through the connecting links of the preconscious\"108 (i.e., the matrix of word-presentations [Wortvorstellungen], as per Freud\\'s schema according to which unconscious thing-presentations gen], in order to gain the potential of possibly entering into consciousness, must be matched up with word-presentations in the preconscious).109 One of the guiding assumptions apparently steering Green\\'s proposals in 1966 (an assumption he appears to abandon by 1973) is the notion that affective phenomena, in contrast with linguistic-symbolic signifiers as structured ational representations, enjoy a nonrelational self-sufficiency, an immediate identity-to-self as sameness, in contrast with the mediated non-self-identity of signifiers as (to quote Saussure ) \"differences without positive terms.\" 110 AFFECTS ARE SIGNIl\\'IERS Ł 205 ',\n",

Interestingly, both Lacanian sis and affective neuroscience seem to concur that this equation is problematic, if not nonsensically impossible. Empirical studies of the brain have uncovered evidence supporting the Freudian-Lacanian thesis regarding the distinction between emotional affects and cognitive representations.l!l However, one should bear in mind that the neurosciences also often simultaneously maintain that, in most real-time brain dynamics, emotions and cognitions, although tinguishable through neuroanatomical analysis, are de facto indistinguishable through neurodynamic synthesis insofar as they are inextricably intertwined in lived reality. Apropos Lacan, one of the best ways to secure a grip on the nature of and justifications for his fashion of differentiating between signifiers and affects is to return to the topic of deception. For Lacan, both signifiers and affects are deceptive. But, they each deceive, according to him, in ways that are fundamentally different in kind. Going through Lacan\\'s corpus and cataloguing the numerous forms of deception engendered by signifiers detailed therein would be a daunting, protracted task (one not to be undertaken here). Zizek, for instance, often draws tion to the title of Lacan\\'s twenty-first seminar of 1973-1974: Les non-dupes errant (\"the non-dupes err:\\' roughly homophonous with ie Nom-du-Pere [the Name-of-the-FatherJ). Succinctly summarized, the Name-of-the-Father, as a master signifier (51) underpinning the symbolic order as the universe of other signifiers (52), is a bluff, fake, fiction, illusion, myth, semblance, and so on.ll2 The entire Symbolic big Other constitutes a fantasmatic \"virtual reality\" not entirely governed by what is presumed to be actual concrete being.l13 The late Lacan, in the twenty-fourth seminar, goes so far as to declare that \"the bolic tells nothing but lies.\"1l4 And yet, as Zizek, following Lacan, is fond of reminding his readers, he/she who refuses to be \"taken in\" by the trickery of the signifier-mediated virtual reality of the symbolic order-such a cynical nominalist, empiricist, or positivist \"non-dupe\" stubbornly sticks to beliefs in absolutely singular and unique entities, conceptually unprocessed raw perceptual experience, and brute facts-in-themselves wholly independent of 206 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS ',\n",

In the sixteenth seminar, Lacan distinguishes between \"dupery\" (duperie) and \"deception\" (tromperie), The latter implies a standard of representational accuracy or faithfulness vis-a.-vis an extrarepresentational point of reference. Degrees of deception, in Lacan\\'s specific sense, are measured according to the criteria of a correspondence theory of truth. As he rightly observes, analysis is not in the least bit invested in a correspondence theory of truth, at least as it\\'s commonly construed. Analysts aren\\'t (or, at least, shouldn\\'t be) occupied with speculations about the representational veracity of, say, hood memories or depictions of recent events transpiring off the couch outside the analytic consulting room. One could say that analysis concerns itself more with a coherence theory of truth, with the consistencies and inconsistencies of the networks of associative connections internal to the webs of analysands\\' monologues. Whether the nodes in these verbal networks are realistic tions or fictitious fantasies is both unknowable within the framework of an analysis and ultimately unimportant to its long-term progress. For example, an analysand who consistently lies to his/her analyst, fabricating all of his/her reported dreams, fantasies, and so on, still discloses to the analyst the truths of his/her unconscious, telling \"true lies\" despite him-/herself insofar as the very selection of the fabricated verbal material cannot help but be itself ing; such an inadvertent \"telling the truth in the guise oflying\" would be the mirror-image correlate of the Lacanian notion of \"lying in the guise of truth.\" This is one very Freudian reverberation of Lac an\\'s opening line from his sion appearance: \"I always speak the truth\" (\\'\\'Ie dis toujours fa veriti\"),117 the \"I\" AFFECTS ARE SIGNIFIERS Ł 207 ',\n",

Generally speaking, he reduces affects to felt feelings (Empjindungen) and characterizes such consciously registered sentiments (or senti-ments) as either opaque signals confusedly gesturing at a reality of a different order than their own (i.e., rhe unconscious \"other scene\" composed of signifiers as nonaffective ideational representations [Vorstellungen]) or the red herrings of affictuations disguising and concealing repressed signifying structures. In a sense, Lacan judges affects according to a correspondence theory of truth, albeit one internal to the (in)coherent chical reality\" of the parletre talking on rhe couch: the relative truth or falsity, honesty or dishonesty, of affects (as felt feelings) is measured against the dards of signifiers (as purportedly different in kind from feelings). Another angle of approach to these issues is to observe that, from Lacan\\'s perspective, signifiers and affects both can be misleading, although rhey lead in utterly distinct modes. In this view, affects tend to mislead at the level of why they are, but not what they are. When one feels angry, sad, and so on, what\\'s misleading is not the qualitative phenomenal feel of the feeling per se, but rather the true (unfeeling) causes, logics, objects, and reasons (all ated within nonaffective representational registers) responsible for the gence in conscious experience of this feeling state-and this insofar as Lacan, as already noted (in chapter II), regularly argues that affects, limited to rhe status of felt feelings and nothing more, are only ever displaced within sciousness along unfurling chains of signifiers, some of which are repressed or unconscious in ways that affects, according to him, cannot be repressed or unconscious. Lacan\\'s psychoanalytic appropriation of Saussurian linguistics combines, among orher things, Saussure\\'s definition of the signifier as a purely differential (non) entity determined by its relations with other such ties and Freud\\'s psychoanalytic thesis that representational contents and ciative connections in mental life-for Lacan, rhese contents are signifiers and these connections are their relations-can be (and often are) unconscious.

The entire preceding project, especially through its return to the textual details of Freud\\'s discussions of affective phenomena and explorations of rent affective neuroscience, undermines this Lacanian fashion of ating between affects and signifiers. In the combined lights of Freud and the neurosciences, if the term affict refers to much more than just consciously felt feelings (i.e., Freudian Empfindungen, as distinct from Affikte and Gefohle), then a very disturbing, unsettling truth reveals itself: affects can and do mislead at the level of not only why they are, but what they are, that is, how they feel. In a Hegelian-style formulation, perhaps it could be said that the distinction between affects and signifiers is a distinction internal to the category of the Signifier itself With respect to Lacan, this formulation isn\\'t as objectionable as it might seem at first glance. To cut a long story short, Lacan\\'s signifier isn\\'t essarily a unit of language as per linguistics. Rather, anything can be a signifier if its status and function rely upon its positions in constellations of synchronic systems and diachronic dynamics in which spatial and temporal differences are decisive. Other materials besides the phonetic and graphic materials of natural languages can and do operate as signifiers as defined by both Lacan and various versions of a post-Saussurian general semiotics.ll9 But, one lingering, nagging question remains: if affects can be signifiers insofar as the category of signifier is a formal rather than a substantial category, then what are affects? During his television appearance, Lacan, in response to Miller drawing attention to the word unconscious, says regarding this master word for psychoanalysis: \"Freud didn\\'t find a better one, and there\\'s no need to go back on it. The disadvantage of this word is that it is negative, which allows one to assume anything at all in the world about it, plus everything else as well. Why not? To that which goes unnoticed, the word everywhere applies just as well as nowhere.\"12o If, as these observations indicate, the problem with the word unconscious is that it\\'s a negative term (un-) for a positive x-Lacan immediately adds, \"It is nonetheless a very precise thing\"121-the problem with the word affict might be the exact opposite: it\\'s a positive tGrm for a negative x, namely, the absence of a coherent concept referring, in a precise one-to-one AFFECTS ARE SIGNIFIERS Ł 209 ',\n",

Even drawing boundary lines circumscribing a general domain that would be the realm of the affects proper (as manifestly distinct from other things) is incredibly tricky and uncertain. And yet, just as Lacan chooses not to jettison the word unconscious despite its noted drawbacks, maybe the fuzzy word affict ought to be retained precisely because the realities it designates are themselves fuzzy. If affict is indeed a positive term for a negative x, this negativity isn't merely ical-representational (i.e., a deficiency or lack at the level of the concept alone). Redeploying the distinctions between emotions and various shades and sorts offeelings uncovered by recent affective neuroscience, one should perhaps retain the term ajfict precisely to designate the uniquely human zations between emotions and feelings as well as among feelings themselves, that is, the actual, palpable absences of in-synch harmonies afflicting the ies, brains, and psyches of partially denaturalized subjects of signifiers. For such subjects, affective life must be lived under the permanent shadow of doubts about passions and sentiments as self-evident, self-transparent, and self-sufficient experiences. Reflexive self-consciousness, thanks to the reflexivity of feeling itself, never will seize upon solid guarantees vouching for the ultimate, final truths of why it feels, how it feels, or even what it feels. A lot can happen in the gaps between emotions, feelings, and the feelings of feelings. With the combined resources of Lacan's Freudian foundations and the rapidly lating findings of the neurosciences, the time is ripe for Lacanian explorations in both psychoanalysis and neurobiology of this terrain that no longer ably can be neglected. 2.10 Ł MISFELT FEELINGS \",\n",

It is this confrontation that our work undertakes here, a work insisting on the importance of the new libidinal economy currently emerging at the intersection of these disciplines and revealing new definitions of affects. The most striking affirmations of contemporary neurobiologists like sio or LeDoux concern the importance of the emotional brain. All the tive operations closely depend on it. Affects function initially at a primitive biological and cerebral level that does not involve consciousness. There fore exists non conscious affects, and the brain is their place of origin. This is why it is important, for the neurobiologists, to redefine the psyche according to this primordial emotionality. What challenges do such affirmations throw at psychoanalysis and philosophy? Psychoanalysis: Are There Unconscious Feelings? During the course of a meticulous and passionate investigation, Adrian ston explores, in Freud and Lacan, the fate of the feelings of guilt and anxiety first, and then those of shame and modesty. Why this exploration? Johnston ',\n",
       " 'with a great deal of pertinence, that the of affects seems in many respects to have been neglected psychoanalysis. For one thing, this is because, for Freud as for Lacan, emotions and feelings cannot but be scious. This is why emotions and feelings can be displaced or inhibited, but never repressed. In other words, and paradoxically, the unconscious, where the pleasure principle is located, is little concerned with affects as such. In his metapsychological writings, Freud declares, in 1915, that it is herent to assume the existence of unconscious affects. How could one feel something without being conscious of it? In response to this question appears Johnston\\'s very beautiful formulation: How can there be seen to be something like misftlt ftelings? How can it be supposed that \"one can feel without feeling that one feels, namely, that there can be, so to speak, unfelt (or, more accurately, misfelt) feelings?\" Lacan will return to this Freudian position in affirming that feelings, if they merit their name, cannot but be experienced in ness and that neither unconscious nor, thus, \"misfelt\" feelings exist. As is well known, Lacan takes care to distinguish between, on the one hand, affects, which always are conscious, and, on the other hand, signifiers, which truly and totally constitute the register of the unconscious. An \"affective\" unconscious therefore is nonsense. All the same, from 1907 on, Freud circles around the possibility of ting the existence of \"an unconscious feeling of guilt:\\' an idea picked back up in \"The Unconscious\" of 1915. We should remember that the third section of that metapsychological essay is entitled \"Unconscious Emotions.\" less, after having envisaged this hypothesis, Freud pushes it aside. He employs some very interesting terms that he never takes the trouble to define and guish, such as affective structures (Affektbildungen), affects (Affekte), emotions ( Gefuhle), and ftelings (Empjindungen). In much later texts, like The Ego and the Id (1923), Freud speaks again of an \"unconscious sense of guilt:\\' He seems at this point to recognize, in the second topography, a structural relationship of the unconscious with affects via the feeling of guilt. He already had opened the possibility of such a feeling in texts such as \"Some Character-Types Met with in Psycho-Analytic Work\" of 1916 (in the section entitled \"Criminals from a Sense of Guilt\"), where there appears a feeling of gUilt certainly conscious but where that consciousness does not know what this guilt is about: an obscure guilt that is unaware ofitsel£ This unconscious feeling of guilt is able to manifest itself also in the form of a diffuse anxiety originating from the superego. Guilt even is lated to a \"topographical variety of anxiety.\" Freudthus considers that guilt 2.12. Ł POSTFACE ',\n",
       " 'perhaps can be a \"misfelt feeling\" which gives itself to be felt as an ness, a dissatisfaction-once again, as an anxiety that is vague and without apparent object. Lacan seems more radical still than the Freud of the first topography in terms of negating the existence of unconscious feelings or affects. In the seminar The Ethics of Psychoanalysis, he denounces the confused nature of the recourse to affects and the mixing together of representations and affects. The latter play only a secondary role in relation to the unconscious. It is not a question of fusing affects and the ideational representations they can merely accompany. There is no representational rapport between affect and signifier. In reality, Lacan\\'s position is more nuanced. In the tenth seminar, Anxiety, he correctly states that anxiety is an affect, an affect that it really is necessary to call unconscious. And, perhaps it is possible to reconcile here what Lacan calls asenti-ment, playing with the two verbs sentir (to feel) andmentir (to lie), with what Johnston names a \"misfelt feeling.\" Anxiety does not know in the face of what it is anxious. For this reason, like guilt, it manifests itself as an uneasiness, as a dissatisfaction more than as an affect that is clear and perfectly certain of its object. Consequently, anxiety is well defined as \"the central affect, the one around which everything is organized,\" the \"fundamental affect.\" If psychoanalysis ends with recognizing the importance of affects, can one now envision possible points of passage between psychoanalysis and contemporary neurobiology? The problem is that psychoanalysis has never admitted the tral importance of cerebral activity in psychical functioning. Freud never contested the appropriateness of the metaphor of the brain as an \"electrical center\" developed by Breuer in the Studies on Hysteria. ing to this metaphor, the brain is a pure and simple place where the sion of energy occurs, a simple mechanism. Breuer declares: We ought not to think of a cerebral path of conduction as resembling a phone wire which is only excited electrically at the moment at which it has to function (that is, in the present context, when it has to transmit a signal). We ought to liken it to a telephone line through which there is a constant flow of galvanic current and which can no longer be excited if that current ceases. Or better, let us imagine a widely-ramified electrical system for lighting and the transmission of motor power; what is expected of this system is that simple POSTFACE Ł 213 ',\n",

In just the same way there is a certain amount of excitation present in the conductive paths of the brain when it is at rest but awake and prepared to work.] Now, there exists \"an optimum for the height of the intracerebral tonic tion.\"2 When this is exceeded, it produces in the system the equivalent of a \"short circuit\": \"I shall venture once more to recur to my comparison with an electrical lighting system. The tension in the network oflines of conduction in such a system has an optimum too. If this is exceeded its functioning may easily be impaired; for instance, the electric light filaments may be quickly burned through. I shall speak later of the damage done to the system itself through a break-down of its insulation or through \\'short-circuiting:\"} The brain therefore has no other possibility for coping with energetic excess than malfunctioning. It is not equipped with any structure of fluidification via detour-that is to say, via differentiation (dijforenciation )-of energy. In other words, it does not enjoy any mechanism of representation. Lacan will affirm exactly the same thing: the brain, a purely biological and organic entity, is not endowed with representations. Thus, for Freud as for Lacan, the drive (Trieb, pulsion) is never a cerebral given. The \"thrust\" (poussee) of the drive, despite the urgency of the pressure it exerts, does not effectively manifest itself, as Johnston recalls, except by resentation or delegation. At its temporal origins, it splits itself into a sioning power (mandateur) and its commissioned proxy (mandataire). The drive then sends representatives in order to say that it cannot wait. It is this representative structure that qualifies and characterizes the particular rapport between the somatic and the psychical which is at work in the drive\\'s structure. Freud develops on this point two conceptions that are contradictory only in appearance. According to Laplanche and Pontalis, \"Sometimes the instinct [la pulsion] itself is presented as \\'the psychical representative of the stimuli nating from within the organism and reaching the mind: At other times the instinct becomes part of the process of somatic excitation, in which case it is represented in the psyche by \\'instinctual representatives\\' [les representants de la pulsion] which comprise two elements-the ideational representative lungsreprdsentanz, representant-representation] and the quota of affect.\"4 214 Ł POSTFACE ',\n",

The extreme pressure exercised by drive on the nervous system therefore is not only quantitative but also qualitative: that which pushes is simultaneously the quantity of force and the division of instances put in tion in the force, namely, representative and quota. The cut or separation between the two, obtained by repression, is hence the sole possible solution to the excess of stressful endogenous urgings: division, procrastinating, and delaying permit deferring (differer) the pressure of the inside without voking \"short circuits.\" From the perspective of Freudian-Lacanian psychoanalysis, this separation provoked by repression certainly cannot be the result of a biological operation.s In effect, for the cut to take place, it is necessary that psychical energy detach itself from neural (nerveuse) energy. The vicissitudes of the drives-\"reversal into its opposite, turning round upon the subject\\'s own self, repression, mation\"6-assume a place other than the cerebral topography. Psychical energy is, in a way, the rhetorical detour of neural energy. Unable to discharge itself in the nervous system, endogenous excitation makes detours comparable to the tropes or figures of discourse. Because, for Freud, symbolic activity does not exist in the nervous system, psychical energy represents this very absence in a style that is foreign to the brain. This brain does not have any initiative in the treatment of an energy it can only transmit and maintain at a constant level to the extent that this is possible? \"Psychical\" energy therefore comes to reveal the absence of a tional and symbolic power in cerebral organization. The nervous system, of which the first task is to master excitations, does not represent the relation of representation that originally unites and divides the psyche and the body. It does not develop representations of the \"sources of internal excitation of the organism.\" Insofar as it cannot affect itself, it also is not a psyche. In Freud\\'s thinking, as is known, sexuality does not designate primarily the sexual drives or sexual life, but actually a certain regime of events governed by a specific causality. Now, this causality finds its source in the possibility of the cut-this cut is at work in every drive, sexual or not (the drives are all similar qualitatively, writes Freud)-between representation and affect.

The exogenous event, when it happens, necessarily finds itself separated from its very exteriority in enlisting itself in the endogenous adventure of meaning (sens). Thus, one will not be surprised that what \"libido\" (qua affect related initially to the sexual drive stricto sensu) ends up designating, in Freud, is the mobility or the \"rhetoric\" of the quota of affect in general. In the same manner that there exists an \"enlarged\" meaning of sexuality (as a type of causality and specific regime of events), there also exists, by way of consequence, an \"enlarged\" sense of the word libido. The mobile character of the libido, which renders it tible to detours, becomes the dominant trait of psychical energy as a whole. The treatment of the sexual drive becomes paradigmatic for every drive vicissitude. Lacan shows that the libido, far from being only a dynamic manifestation of the sexual drive, designates, in fact, \"an undifferentiated quantitative unit ceptible of entering into relations of equivalence.\"8 Even if, as one will see later on here, it is far from being the only psychical energy at work in the psyche, the libido gives its name to every energetic transaction. \"Hence one would talk;\\' Lacan continues, \"of transformations, regressions, fixations, sublimations of the libido, a single term which is conceived of quantitatively.\"9The libido therefore truly has for its function the unification of afield (champ )-not simply that of different phases and structures of sexual development, but also, and precisely, that of the \"field of psychoanalytic effects\" (champ des ejfets psychanalytiques) in general, the energetic tropes or tropisms that go beyond the organization of the nervous system.1O Contemporary neurobiological discoveries put into question these analytic notions. The Freudian conception of a brain foreign to symbolic activity, a brain that is a purely material base without autonomy in the treatment of its own energetic urgings, is in the process of totally disappearing today. trary to what the psychoanalysts affirm, the \"emotional brain\" is apt to support endogenous excitations or drives. In light of this fact, the frontiers between, on the one side, the brain and the cerebral organization and, on the other side, the psychical apparatus and the unconscious find themselves reelaborated. 216 Ł POSTFACE ',\n",

Emotion, according to its literal sense, designates a relational dynamic between brain and body, the very movement of the somatic totality, comprises \\nan individual body and a nervous system. It is this totality in movement that, as I have shown in my text, Damasio interprets in terms of conatus. Between the nervous system and the body a constant exchange of information takes place (which draws these \"maps\" of which we spoke much earlier). In fact, only one word is needed in order \\nto deSignate the two entities: organism, which refers as much to cerebral organization as to bodily structure. The dynamic of emotion has its origin precisely in this elementary activity of exchange of information and autoregulation of the organism.

There is consequently a sort of pure emotion of vitality, without any object other than the \"self,\\' namely, the cerebral \"self:\\' which Damasio calls the \"protoself\" Far from being a mechanical energetic process, comparable to the ing of an electrical switchboard or telephone exchange, homeostasis, the self\\'s information about itself and the maintenance of life, is an affective and tional economy-something psychoanalysis has never envisaged. The maintenance of excitation at its lowest level, necessary for the survival and elementary activity of the system, is the producer of affects: the brain affects itself in regulating life. There is therefore no \"principle of inertia\" -this is the name Freud gives to the principle of constancy-without emotion, that is to say, without the autoaffection of the mechanism that produces the tenance of the system. \"Curiously enough;\\' writes Damasio, \"emotions are part and parcel of the regulation we call homeostasis.\"ll We thus arrive at this ishing paradox: maintenance, constancy, inertia, and homeostasis are the ucts of an autoexcitation. The \"emotional brain\" must be understood precisely starting from this paradox. The emotions organize and coordinate cerebral activity. Whether cerning primary emotions (sadness, joy, fear, surprise, disgust), secondary or \"social\" emotions (embarrassment, jealousy, guilt, pride), or even emotions said to be \"in the background\" (well-being, uneasiness, calm, despondency), the emotions are all elaborate ensuing continuations of affective processes at work in homeostatic regulation.

Even Damasio insists that pleasure is not exactly an emotion, although, unlike Freud, he ties the pleasure-pain spectrum quite closely to affective ena.13 Moreover, Damasio affirms that emotion is a reflexive structure through which vital regulation affects itself: \"the status oflife regulation is expressed in the form of affects:\\'14 The cerebral sites that produce emotion occupy a zone which starts at the level of the brain stem and goes up to the cortex. Outside of a part of the tal lobe called the prefrontal ventromedial cortex, the majority of these sites are subcortical-sites that Freud had considered as being without relation to the unconscious. The principle subcortical sites are located in regions of the brain stem, the hypothalamus, and the basal telencephalon. The amygdala, or the amygdala complex-this is the almond-shaped \\ngroup of neurons situated in the temporal lobe in front of the hippocampus-is equally a determinant subcortical site in the triggering of emotions. It forms that part of the limbic system implicated notably in fear and aggression. What the anatomy of the relation between the triggering and execution of emotions shows is that the distribution of emotional processes over many sites permits the brain to discipline and treat the internal sources of excitation out being overwhelmed by them, without producing, contrary to what Breuer affirms, \"short circuits.\" These sites are not rigid and fixed, but instead stitute functional systems. Damasio emphasizes that \"none of these triggering sites produces an emotion by itself For an emotion to occur the site must cause subsequent activity in other sites .... As with any other form of complex ior, emotion results from the concerted participation of several sites within a brain\\'s system.\"lS It is hence clear that the intensity of internal sources of tion is treated from within the nervous system in a functional and interactive manner that assumes the collaboration of many sites.

This change of conception has considerable consequences, since it has to do with nothing less than a change in the very meaning of the unconscious. We do not seek here to situate biologically this unconscious \\nin opposing tion and drive. Researchers such as Mark Solms, for example, categorically refuse to localize the unconscious. In any case, writes Solms, it is not a question of saying that \"the unconscious is located in the right hemisphere\" nor that it merges with the inductive sites for emotions. If a cerebral unconscious exists, related to the emotional brain, then it necessarily is, like the emotional brain, also a distributed functional system and, consequently, cannot be situated in this or that anatomical \"region.\" All the same, anatomy plays a major role here. To insist on the biological spatiality of the sites for emotion permits establishing that the cerebral scious is first of all related both to the brain\\'s treatment of internal excitations as well as to the autorepresentative activity that is tied to this treatment there. This unconscious is constituted by the \"core\" (noyau) that corresponds to the neuronal elaboration of a representation, constant and changing, of the chosomatic rapport and that determines the original, primitive attachment of the attachment to life. The representative activity internal to the brain and the unconscious responds to a certain type of image-making (mise en image). Damasio writes: \"core consciousness occurs when the brain\\'s representation devices generate an imaged, nonverbal account of how the organism\\'s own state is aJficted by the organism\\'s processing of an object:\\'16 This cartography of the relationship between the inside and the outside reveals the biological history of the ism \"caught in the act of representing its own changing state as it goes about representing something else.\" 17 The core \"protosel£\" the primitive form of identity, is therefore a stant interaction between the internal milieu and the external world.

Therefore, in the brain, there is no regulation without representation. This double economy precisely defines bral identity as a constant synthesis of different states of relation between body and psyche, as an equilibrium, in a word, of the organism. A question poses itself at this moment of the analysis: Is not defining the scious as a nonconscious activity to fall back into the famous trap, denounced by Freud, that consists in conflating the unconscious (Unbewujt) and the conscious (Bewujtlos)? Would this not be to remain outside the significance of the psychical unconscious? It is certain that if one simply characterizes the cerebral unconscious as the nonconscious place where homeostatic processes are afoot, one risks, in effect, falling into this trap and clinging to an insufficient and uncritically pre-ian definition of the unconscious. Things proceed entirely otherwise if one calls \"cerebral unconscious\" the \"cerebralization\" of ajfects,l9 that is to say, an active and sui generis process of regulation. All the data that the brain gives (itself) on the internal state of the organism and on the relations of the organism with objects is accompanied by the production of affects. The autorepresentative activity of the brain, which ceaselessly maps psychosomatic states, hence tinizes its own inside, putting it into images and affecting itself by this activity of which it is, as seen, the receiver and addressee.

The logic of cerebral autoaffection does not presume the intervention of an extra supplementary energy that is endowed with the status of the libido. The distinction between the self (moi) and the object appears before any and every narcissism and sexual investment. The psychical apparatus appears hence as the core that gathers together, in the same energetic economy, the constant exigency of survival, the relation to self, and the desire of the other. How can one comprehend more exactly the concept of the brain's fection? Traditionally, as I have shown in my analysis of wonder, the notion of autoaffection designates, in philosophy, the original and paradoxical manner in which the subject feels itself to be identical to itself in addressing itself to itself as to another in the strange space of its inner depths. It has to do with a sort of primordial touching of self-the subject senses itself, speaks itself, hears itself speaking, experiences the succession of states of consciousness. This tact produces the difference of self to self without which, paradoxically, there would be neither identity nor permanence. Autoaffection is the original power of the subject to interpellate itself, to autosolicit itself and constitute itself as a subject in this double movement of identity and alrerity to self Homeostatic regulation is, in a certain sense, a mirroring structure of larity within which the brain informs itself of itselpo Emotion plays a mental role in the constitution of this cerebral psyche: the brain affects itself, that is to say, modifies itself in the constant course of vital regulation. The stakes of neurobiological research consist in drawing out from the elementary rapport of the brain with itself and with the other the idea of a cerebral identity that is the unconscious part of subjectivity. This is the paradox that I have sought to illuminate in my essay: fection is not opposed to the idea of the unconscious; instead, the former constitutes the latter. In this resides one of the most important teachings of contemporary neurobiology. Cerebral autoaffection is not of the same nature as the autoaffection of a subject such as philosophers define it. Cerebral fection does not redouble its specularity up to the point of giving itself the form of consciousness. Nobody feels his/her brain-nobody any longer speaks to him-/herself of it, hears him-/herself speak of it, or hears him-/herself in it. Cerebral autoaffection is paradoxically and necessarily accompanied by an impassibility and neutrality of the conscious subject as regards it. If the subject POSTFACE Ł 221 \",\n",
       " 'can affect itself, it is thanks to the brain: the first contact with the self that is homeostasis renders this contact possible. at the same time, this original solicitation dissimulates itself in the very thing that it makes possible. My brain never appears in my inner depths. The brain is not visible except in an objective manner through the snapshots produced by brain-imaging niques. Hence, original emotions remain forever lost for consciousness. But, this does not signify that the cerebral unconscious limits itself solely to the nonconscious. In effect, an entire history hides itself in primitive emotions, and it is evident that events lived by the subject playa role in cerebral autoaffection in the manner in which the conatus informs and maintains itself. The neurobiologists seem in other places sometimes to recognize a certain proximity between the functioning of the protoself and the ego (moi) of the Freudian second topography.21 The ego, like core consciousness, effectively appears as a perceptive surface where internal excitations and external demands meet each other coming from opposite directions. Jaak Panksepp elsewhere defines the protoself as a \"Simple Ego-like Life Form\" (SELF). \\nSolms ments that \"this primal SELF forms the foundational \\'ego\\' upon which all our more complex representations of our selves are built.\"22 The \"ego\" of Freud and the \"self\" (soi) of the neurobiologists have the common characteristic of being frontier or limit concepts between the perception of internal states and the perception of external events, interfaces between inner sensations, sensibility, and mobility. But, the analogy brings itself to a halt abruptly. Damasio point-blank compares the self to a \"homunculus:\\' this \"little man\" that many gists and neurologists-Freud included-have conceived of as \"inhabiting\" the interior of the ego. In The Ego and the Jd, Freud declares that, as regards the ego, \"If we wish to find an anatomical analogy for it we can best identify it with the \\'cortical homunculus\\' of the anatomists, which stands on its head in the cortex, sticks up its heels, faces backwards and, as we know, has its speech-area on the left-hand side.\"23 The homunculus corresponds to a figural representation of a part of the nervous system. There is, in a sense, a sort of subject in the subject, devoted to interpreting the images and representations formed in the brain.24 Damasio affirms that \"the protoself\" is not \"to be confused with the rigid homunculus of old neurology.\"25 It is necessary to avoid this confusion to the extent that \"the proto-self does not occur in one place only, and it emerges dynamically and continuously out of multifarious interacting Signals that span varied orders of the nervous system. Besides, the proto-self is not an interpreter 222 Ł POSTFACE ',\n",

In effect, the \"self\" is not substantial. Its manifestation is fundamentally temporal. The self is not what it is except inasmuch as it endures and fabricates itself at each instant: \"The story contained in the images of core consciousness is not told by some clever homunculus. Nor is the story really told by you as a self because the core you is only born as the story is told, within the story itself. You exist as a mental being when primordial stories are being told, and only then; as long as primordial stories are being told, and only then.

The cerebral self has no presence-to-sel£ In this sense, it is always anonymous; it is no one in wholly being the most elementary form of identity. It is thus possible to measure the entire distance that separates the nal unconscious from the unconscious as traditionally defined. The former merges in a certain fashion with the passage of time, whereas the latter ignores time. Freud writes, \"The processes of the system Ucs. are timeless; i.e. they are not ordered temporally, are not altered by the passage of time; they have no reference to time at all. Reference to time is bound up ... with the work of the system CS.\"28 To these assertions are related those according to which the unconscious does not know death: \"Our unconscious, then, does not believe in its own death; it behaves as if it were immortal.\"29 By contrast, cerebral autoaffection is the announcement and the incessant internal reminder of mortality. Damasio declares, \"We do not have a self sculpted in stone and, like stone, resistant to the ravages of time. Our sense of self is a state of the organism, the result of certain components operating in a certain manner and interacting in a certain way, within certain parameters. It is another struction, a vulnerable pattern of integrated operations whose consequence is to generate the mental representation of a living individual being.
